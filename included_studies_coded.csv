Differential access to park space based on country of origin within miami’s hispanic/latino population: A novel analysis of park equity,"Allain, M.L.; Collins, T.W.","Some U.S.-based park equity studies reveal that affluent and White neighborhoods have privileged access to greenspace. In such studies in the U.S. and elsewhere, park access indicators are typically examined in relation to measures of income, housing tenure, and broad race/ethnicity categories (e.g., Hispanic/Latino, Black, and White in the U.S.). The treatment of people as monolithic ethnic groups in park equity research is potentially misleading, particularly in global cities where ethnic populations are highly heterogeneous. In this study, we assess inequities in access to park space within the diverse Hispanic/Latino population of the Miami Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) based on national origin. We specified multivariable generalized estimating equations to examine social correlates of area-weighted park access at the census tract level. Our first model includes a variable for the proportion of the tract population of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, which we substitute in the second model with variables representing the proportions of the tract population from the most populous country-of-origin groups in the MSA applicable to the Hispanic/Latino population. Our first model indicates robust negative relationships for the proportion Hispanic/Latino and Black/African American variables with area-weighted park access, adjusting for median household income, renter-occupancy, and old and young population composition. Our second model indicates negative relationships based on Cuban and Venezuelan neighborhood composition, while the four other country-of-origin subgroup variables exhibit statistically non-significant associations with area-weighted park access. Study findings have implications for the analysis of ethnicity categories in park equity research and interventions to promote park equity, especially in global cities. © 2021 by the authors.

"Park inequities between and within racial/ethnic groups in the conterminous United States: A micro-scale, individual-level analysis","Allain, M.L.; Collins, T.; Grineski, S.; Rigolon, A.","Previous park equity research documents racial/ethnic inequities in access to park space, but no US national studies have examined park inequities using individual-level data, and few have examined racial/ethnic inequities beyond the major race/ethnicity, categories (e.g., Hispanic/Latino, White/Caucasian, Black/African American). Treating each race/ethnicity group monolithically may mislead, as within-group inequities exist. Here, we utilize restricted-access, individual-level American Community Survey microdata and fine-scale estimates of park accessibility to assess park inequities between major race/ethnicity groups and within those groups based on national/Tribal origin across the United States. In addition to generating new estimates of park access for race/ethnicity (sub)groups, we calculate absolute and relative racial/ethnic disparities in park accessibility nationally and by state. Findings indicate that among the major race/ethnicity groups, Native American and White groups have higher-than-average park access, while Asian, Black, and Latino/a/x groups have lower-than-average park access. Some national origin subgroups (e.g., Dominican, Nigerian) have particularly low park access. Results highlight marked disparities in park access between major race/ethnicity groups as well as within most major race/ethnicity groups based on national/Tribal origin. State-level analyses reveal higher absolute disparities in western states, where park accessibility is higher but inequitable by race/ethnicity, and higher relative disparities in eastern states, where park accessibility is lower and also inequitable. Our findings advance fundamental knowledge about US national park inequities for some major race/ethnicity groups (e.g., Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander) and national/Tribal origin subgroups. This new knowledge can be used to promote recognitional justice as a foundation for pursuing greenspace equity. © 2025 Elsevier GmbH",2025,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,113,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2025.129031,#314,Allain 2025,"Allain et al., 2025",Yes,Yes,Included,,,n/a,census block,11078297,Native American and Alaska Native; Pacific Islander; tribal origins,Park area per capita,"Higher than natioonal average (positive), but differ by tribal origins",United States
"Race, ethnicity, income concentration and 10-year change in urban greenness in the United States","Casey, J.A.; James, P.; Cushing, L.; Jesdale, B.M.; Morello-Frosch, R.","Background: Cross-sectional studies suggest urban greenness is unequally distributed by neighborhood demographics. However, the extent to which inequalities in greenness have changed over time remains unknown. Methods: We estimated 2001 and 2011 greenness using Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite-derived normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) in 59,483 urban census tracts in the contiguous U.S. We ﬁt spatial error models to estimate the association between baseline census tract demographic composition in 2000 and (1) 2001 greenness and (2) change in greenness between 2001 and 2011. Results: In models adjusted for population density, climatic factors, housing tenure, and Index of Concentration at the Extremes for income (ICE), an SD increase in percent White residents (a 30% increase) in 2000 was associated with 0.021 (95% CI: 0.018, 0.023) higher 2001 NDVI. We observed a stepwise reduction in 2001 NDVI with increased concentration of poverty. Tracts with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents in 2000 lost a small, statistically signiﬁcant amount of greenness between 2001 and 2011 while tracts with higher proportions of Whites experienced a small, statistically signiﬁcant increase in greenness over the same period. Conclusions: Census tracts with a higher proportion of racial/ethnic minorities, compared to a higher proportion of White residents, had less greenness in 2001 and lost more greenness between 2001 and 2011. Policies are needed to increase greenness, a health-promoting neighborhood asset, in disadvantaged communities. © 2017 by the authors.

"More extremely hot days, more heat exposure and fewer cooling options for people of color in Connecticut, U.S.","Chen, S.; Lund, K.; Murphy-Dunning, C.; Seto, K.C.","It is well-documented that people of color in the U.S. are disproportionately exposed to extreme urban heat. However, most studies have focused on large cities for one point in time, and less is known about how heat exposure changes over time in smaller cities. Here, we present a study of the changing nature of urban heat exposure and cooling strategies for ten cities in Connecticut in the U.S. Our results show that people of color experience more heat exposure and fewer adaptation strategies. They experienced higher overall temperatures, more extremely hot days, and larger increases in heat exposure. Also, they have lower air conditioning ownership rates and lower tree cover. Taken together, the results indicate that people of color are not only exposed to higher temperatures but also disproportionately exposed to increasing temperatures over time. With lower heat adaptation capacity, people of color are more vulnerable to increasing urban heat. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,npj Urban Sustainability,4,1,,10.1038/s42949-024-00186-5,#1384,Chen 2024,"Chen et al., 2024b",Yes,Yes,Included,,,10,census block,,American Indian and Alaska Native; then merged Asian and Pacific Islander,NDVI,Negative (but statistical tests not reported),United States
Comparing methods for measuring park access and equity using US census microdata in metropolitan Miami,"Collins, T.W.; Allain, M.L.; Grineski, S.E.; Rigolon, A.","Knowledge from prior park equity studies has been limited by differences in the spatial analytic techniques applied to measure park accessibility, a lack of systematic methods comparisons, and overreliance on aggregated spatial data. Our study addresses these issues using individual-level, restricted-access US Census American Community Survey microdata (n = 339,000) from 2015 to 2019 to compare (a) alternative techniques for measuring access to park space and (b) how those measurement techniques affect inferences regarding patterns of inequity. It applies spatial analytic techniques to generate four park area per capita measures—one gold standard measure at the census block level and three widely-used measures at the census tract level in metropolitan Miami, USA—and compares the four methods using multiple analyses. The four methods generate somewhat dissimilar park accessibility values for individual residents. Bivariate analyses indicate that racially/ethnically minoritized or lower socioeconomic status people have less park accessibility than people from more advantaged groups, no matter the measure used. Multivariable models for each park accessibility measure yield largely dissimilar results regarding associations with social indicators, with consistent results for only two social indicators: Hispanic/Latino and older (>64 years) people have less park area per capita relative to non-Hispanic White and middle-aged (18–64 years) people, respectively. Findings suggest that advanced, fine-scale spatial analytic techniques should be applied to accurately characterize park accessibility for academic research and decision-making about parks. Findings also highlight the need to increase park space access for marginalized groups in metropolitan Miami. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2025,Applied Geography,178,,,10.1016/j.apgeog.2025.103579,#740,Collins 2025,"Collins et al., 2025",Yes,Yes,Included,,,107 incorporated places (derived from online resources); 3 counties,individuals; census tract; census block,individuals: 339000; census block: 81428; census tracts: 1192,American Indian or Alaska Native; Pacific Islander included but not showndue to low counts,park accessibility,positive throughout,United States
Behavior-encoded models reveal differentiated access to public cooling environment by race and income,"Li, C.; Su, X.; Fan, C.; Han, H.","Extreme heat events caused by continuous anthropogenic climate change have been increasing. Establishing public cooling environments (PCEs) is imperative for protecting public health and enhancing productivity. Yet, disparities in access to PCEs based on race, travel behavior, and income status can undermine their role in helping communities cope with extreme heat. This study investigates the varied access to three types of PCEs across 40 U.S. counties. Our findings reveal that White people enjoy greater access to PCEs than other groups, especially to tree-covered green spaces (TCGSs), outperforming Black people approximately three times. Driving can disproportionately narrow the racial/ethnic inequality gap compared to walking. Non-expense-required public environments (NERPEs) and expense-required public environments (ERPEs) are less accessible to high-income groups. Our research underscores the ongoing challenges in achieving environmental justice through equitable PCE access and stresses the importance of further studies and policy actions to eliminate disparities. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,npj Urban Sustainability,4,1,,10.1038/s42949-024-00157-w,#1429,Li 2024,"Li et al., 2024b",Yes,Yes,Included,,,40 counties,census block group,44539,American Indian,tree cover,not significant,United States
Who has access to urban vegetation? A spatial analysis of distributional green equity in 10 US cities,"Nesbitt, L.; Meitner, M.J.; Girling, C.; Sheppard, S.R.J.; Lu, Y.","This research examines the distributional equity of urban vegetation in 10 US urbanized areas using very high resolution land cover data and census data. Urban vegetation is characterized three ways in the analysis (mixed vegetation, woody vegetation, and public parks), to reflect the variable ecosystem services provided by different types of urban vegetation. Data are analyzed at the block group and census tract levels using Spearman's correlations and spatial autoregressive models. There is a strong positive correlation between urban vegetation and higher education and income across most cities. Negative correlations between racialized minority status and urban vegetation are observed but are weaker and less common in multivariate analyses that include additional variables such as education, income, and population density. Park area is more equitably distributed than mixed and woody vegetation, although inequities exist across all cities and vegetation types. The study finds that education and income are most strongly associated with urban vegetation distribution but that various other factors contribute to patterns of urban vegetation distribution, with specific patterns of inequity varying by local context. These results highlight the importance of different urban vegetation measures and suggest potential solutions to the problem of urban green inequity.

"Wealthy, educated, and… non-millennial? Variable patterns of distributional inequity in 31 Canadian cities","Quinton, J.; Nesbitt, L.; Czekajlo, A.","This article assesses the distribution of urban vegetation in 31 Canadian cities to determine whether certain social-economic/demographic factors are associated with increased proximity to greenness. Using spatial lag models, Canadian census data, and urban ‘greenness fractions’ derived from Landsat imagery, we find diversity between cities in the factors associated with increased urban vegetation. This makes it difficult to establish a single overarching narrative about the state of environmental justice and green equity as it pertains to proximity to vegetation in Canadian cities. Factors such as greater household income and educational attainment were positively associated with proximity to vegetation in numerous cities, while the proportion of millennials was often negatively associated. Variables including the proportion of visible minorities, Indigenous people, and recent immigrants infrequently had significant associations with urban vegetation. These results highlight the need for planning and management actions tailored to individual Canadian cities to improve green equity for marginalized and underserved groups. We discuss the need for funding for greening initiatives and maintenance; democratic participation, engagement, and education opportunities for residents; urban planning that considers the challenge of greening dense environments; and consideration of potential negative outcomes of greening, such as gentrification, to improve green equity in Canadian cities. © 2022 The Authors",2022,Landscape and Urban Planning,227,,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104535,#2894,Quinton 2022,"Quinton et al., 2022",Yes,Yes,Included,,,31,Dissemination Areas,27608,Indigenous identity,Greenness fraction (%) (30 m spatial resolution),"Mixed (not significant for 27, neg for 3, pos for 1)",Canada
Inequitable Spatial and Temporal Patterns in the Distribution of Multiple Environmental Risks and Benefits in Metro Vancouver,"Ren, S.; Giang, A.","The urban environment impacts residents' health and well-being in many ways. Environmental benefits and risks may be interactively and inequitably distributed across different populations in cities, and these patterns may change over time. Here, we assess the spatial distribution of environmental risks and benefits in pairs, considering synergies and trade-offs, in an illustrative metropolitan area (Metro Vancouver) in Canada in the years 2006 and 2016. We classify census dissemination areas as sweet, sour, risky, or medium spots based on relative exposures for six environmental combinations: Walkability and NO<inf>2</inf>; heat stress and NO<inf>2</inf>; vegetation coverage and NO<inf>2</inf>; vegetation coverage and heat stress; walkability and accessibility to natural recreational areas; and heat stress and accessibility to natural recreational areas. We evaluate whether different population groups are disproportionately exposed to lower environmental quality based on linear regressions and other metrics. We find that while performance for individual environmental variables improved over the decade, considering their combinations, sweet spots became sweeter and sour spots became sourer. Residents with high material and social deprivation and visible minorities were disproportionately exposed to lower environmental quality in both years for most of the environmental combinations. Further, we find that these inequities were not improving over time for all groups: for instance, South Asian residents in the region faced higher disproportionate burdens or diminished access to benefits in 2016, as compared to 2006. Given these findings, we suggest considerations of cumulative exposure in prioritizing areas for intervention, targeting the sour and risky spots persistently experienced by overburdened populations. © 2024.

"An investigation of 15-minute neighbourhoods in Surrey, British Columbia: A community-informed social equity analysis for a fast-growing, diverse, Canadian city","Sharma, A.; Chandi, A.; Winters, M.","Introduction: Auto-centric urban design drives health and environmental issues. Proximity-based concepts like “15-minute neighbourhoods” can reduce these harms. Most studies on 15-minute neighbourhoods have been in European centres, and few have incorporated community views. Set in a fast-growing city, this study developed a community-informed definition of 15-minute neighbourhoods and explored social equity in accessibility to amenities. Methods: Based in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada (population 580,000), this mixed-methods study involved mapping and community engagement. We created preliminary maps of 15-minute neighbourhoods by using open data for 6 amenity types (community centres, educational facilities, grocery stores, health facilities, parks, and public transit) and mapping spatial access by walking/cycling for every dissemination area using ArcGIS and r5r. We then hosted focus groups with equity-deserving residents (n = 102) to understand if these preliminary maps aligned with their experiences and gather input on what was missing and what concerns they had. We drew on participants’ input to create a community-informed definition and refined maps. With census data (2021), we conducted a social equity analysis by calculating the percentage of residents living in 15-minute neighbourhoods and assessing access for equity-deserving populations. Results: Overall, 52% of Surrey residents lived in areas considered 15-minute neighbourhoods. Participants felt maps missed some amenities (e.g., places of worship) and that beyond amenities, supportive infrastructure, safety, and terrain were vital. We produced bivariate maps, including microscale design features, highlighting areas with many amenities but little supportive infrastructure. The social equity analysis did not highlight inequities in spatial access; rather, areas with more children/youth living in one-parent households, Indigenous peoples, low income residents, and recent immigrants were more likely to be 15-minute neighbourhoods. Conclusions: Community voices added insights into factors beyond amenities that matter. As proximity-based planning proceeds, care is needed to ensure that future city design meets the needs of all residents. © 2025 The Authors",2025,Journal of Transport and Health,42,,,10.1016/j.jth.2025.102021,#723,Sharma 2025,"Sharma et al., 2025",Yes,Yes,Included,,,1,dissemination areas,665,Indigenous identity,park access (part of broader 15-minute walk),Positive,Canada
The unequal connectivity of parks and tree canopy in 10 U.S. cities,"Stuhlmacher, M.; Kim, Y.","The connectivity of urban green space has a strong influence on the benefits that green space provides—more connected green space has been linked to greater biodiversity, increased recreational opportunities, improved air quality, and increased noise attenuation. Previous urban green space equity research largely focuses on the total amount or accessibility of green space, ignoring connectivity and other measures of configuration that also impact green space equity. Taking both a demographic and spatial approach, we examine whether green space (i.e., park and tree canopy) area, patch size, and connectivity are distributed equally in ten U.S. cities. We find that not only are wealthy, college-educated, and predominately White census tracts more likely to have greater total green space, the green space patches are larger and more connected. This inequality was stronger for tree canopy than for parks, pointing to the need for policy interventions to improve tree canopy connectivity in areas of systematic disinvestment. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH",2024,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,96,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128332,#1747,Stuhlmacher 2024,"Stuhlmacher & Kim, 2024",Yes,Yes,Included,,,10,census tracts,,American Indian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander," - all area, average size, connectivity","Generally n/s, but positive for some native hawaiian, mostly tree canopy.

Parks and safety: a comparative study of green space access and inequity in five US cities,"Williams, T.G.; Logan, T.M.; Zuo, C.T.; Liberman, K.D.; Guikema, S.D.","Safety is an important dimension of access to green space. When parks are perceived as unsafe, people are unlikely to derive the health and community benefits from them. In this study, we examine inequities in green space access in five medium-to-large US cities using parcel-level, network-based analysis. We quantify access using three measures: proximity, congestion-weighted acreage, and crime-constrained proximity. We find that, in the five US cities studied, there is a striking lack of access to safe parks. In addition, inequalities between socioeconomic subgroups are substantially exacerbated when considering access to safe parks, with racial/ethnic minorities and low-income communities fairly consistently worse off. The results suggest that interventions to improve park safety could result in large and immediate improvements for access and environmental justice.

Environmental justice criteria for new land protection can inform efforts to address disparities in access to nearby open space,"Sims, K.R.E.; Lee, L.G.; Estrella-Luna, N.; Lurie, M.R.; Thompson, J.R.","Substantial funding is being allocated to new land protection and access to protected open space for marginalized communities is a crucial concern. Using New England as a study area, we show striking disparities in the distribution of protected open space across multiple dimensions of social marginalization. Using a quartile-based approach within states, we find that communities in the lowest income quartile have just 52% as much nearby protected land as those in the most affluent quartile. Similarly, communities with the highest proportions of people of color have just 47% as much protected land as those in the lowest quartile. These disparities persist across both public and private protected land, within urban, exurban and rural communities, for different sized buffers around communities, and across time. To help address these disparities in future conservation plans, we develop a screening tool to identify and map communities with high social marginalization and low nearby protected open space within each state. We then show that areas prioritized according to these environmental justice (EJ) criteria are substantially different from areas prioritized according to conventional conservation criteria. This demonstrates how incorporating EJ criteria in conservation prioritization processes could shift patterns of future land protection.

Urban flood risk and green infrastructure: Who is exposed to risk and who benefits from investment?

City managers and communities are increasingly interested in reducing their pluvial flood risk through the development of green infrastructure (GI) features. This research explores the relationship between pluvial flood exposure and GI placement in three inland cities-Atlanta, Phoenix, and Portland-and analyzes the variation of sociodemographic variables in census block groups (CBG) located in pluvial flood zones. Using the Arc-MalstrOm method, we estimated areas of pluvial flooding in the CBGs of our selected cities by relating pluvial flood area to the density of GI in CBGs and assigning CBGs one of four classifications: i) managed (large flood area, abundant GI), ii) prepared (small flood area, abundant GI), iii) vulnerable (large flood area, scarce GI), and iv) least concern (small flood area, scarce GI). Then, using the historical GI data, we examined the proportionality of GI investment over time to pluvial flood area. We found relationships between GI density, flood area, ethnic and racial minority populations, age, educational attainment, and median household incomes that indicated inequalities and potential discrimination in flood risk management, but also some evidence of equitable and appropriate management given differences in flood risk, especially in Phoenix and Portland. In Atlanta, newer GI installation prioritized white and wealthy neighborhoods where relatively higher flood risk exists (less equitable).

Disparities in NatureScore™ across U.S. public schools: Implications for environmental and socioeconomic equity,"Ashraf, K.; Lee, K.","This study examines the impacts of NatureScore™ on educational equity by analyzing its correlation with racial demographics and socio-economic status (SES) across 65,406 United States schools. While previous studies have examined nature access in educational contexts regionally, this study uniquely utilizes a comprehensive national dataset, evaluating NatureScore™ disparities across racial and socio-economic groups in urban and rural public schools. Using a cross-sectional design with data from 2022, the variability in NatureScore™ was analyzed concerning the percentages of students from different racial backgrounds and those participating in free or reduced-price lunch (FRPL) programs. Multiple linear regression and bootstrap ANOVA were conducted to assess these relationships. Results show significant disparities: NatureScores™ are higher in schools with lower percentages of economically disadvantaged students and higher percentages of White students, indicating irregular distribution of nature across the U.S. Because NatureScore™ is calculated from 1-km buffers, our estimates reflect equity in the surrounding outdoor environment rather than indoor spaces or on-campus micro-features (like playgrounds, gardens). In urban areas, the gap between low and high socio-economic status schools can reach up to 25 points on a 0 (deficit) to 100 (utopia) NatureScore™ scale. Rural schools also show a consistent decline in NatureScore™ with increasing levels of economic disadvantage, although the differences are smaller (approximately 2.5–5 points) than those observed in urban schools.

We classified green spaces into street-level greenery (XS), neighborhood parks (S-L; walking and cycling access), and large parks (XL; walking, cycling, and driving access). We ran spatial filtering models at the census block group level using different thresholds based on transportation modes. We uncovered a complex picture of inequality, with consistent injustices for XS green space, and fewer injustices for S-L and XL green space based on socioeconomic status and age, and some instances of just distributions for S-L and XL green space based on race/ethnicity. Our findings present a concerning picture for 'just sustainabilities': the green space type that is most often part of sustainability and climate adaptation strategies-street greenery-is unjustly distributed, likely as a result of structural racism in U.S. institutions. By examining multimodal access to green spaces of different sizes, this study helps urban greening professionals develop more just and sustainable strategies. © 2020 by the authors.",2020,Sustainability (Switzerland),12,17,,10.3390/su12176998,#3928,Choi 2020,"Choi et al., 2020",Yes,Yes,Excluded,,because their share of the total population is relatively small in the sampled urban areas,,,,,,,
"Gentrification, neighborhood socioeconomic factors and urban vegetation inequities: A study of greenspace and tree canopy increases in Montreal, Canada","Kiani, B.; Thierry, B.; Fuller, D.; Firth, C.; Winters, M.; Kestens, Y.","This study investigates the relationship between increasing urban vegetation and census tract-level green inequities, as well as the role of social indicators in this relationship. We analyzed the augmentation of greenspace and tree canopy in Montreal, Canada, between 2011 and 2017, and its effect on green inequities based on material deprivation, the percentage of visible minorities, and gentrification status using Poisson spatial random effect models. Our analyses showed an increase in greenspace from 57.4% to 65.8% and tree canopy from 21.1% to 22.3% between 2011 and 2017. Census tracts (CTs) with higher levels of material deprivation or a higher percentage of visible minority population had less greenspace and tree canopy at baseline in 2011. Additionally, CTs that were not gentrified had less greenspace and tree canopy than ineligible for gentrification CTs. Furthermore, CTs with more visible minorities, higher levels of material deprivation, or those that did not gentrify had smaller increases in greenspace and tree canopy between 2011 and 2017. Among CTs with more visible minorities or higher levels of material deprivation, those with greater greenspace and tree canopy at baseline also experienced greater increases during the study time period. Conversely, among ineligible for gentrification CTs, those with less greenspace/tree canopy at baseline experienced greater increase in greenspace/tree canopy. Our analysis revealed that despite an increase in urban vegetation, inequities in urban vegetation persists. To reduce green inequities and promote social equity in this particular study area, urban planning policies should prioritize CTs with higher levels of material deprivation, more visible minorities, or those that did not gentrify, and focus on increasing urban vegetation. © 2023 The Authors",2023,Landscape and Urban Planning,240,,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2023.104871,#2214,Kiani 2023,"Kiani et al., 2023",Yes,Yes,Excluded,,No reason given; uses visible minorities (Canada),,,,,,,
Assessing environmental equity in Massachusetts using GIS,"Anoh, JDH; Xia, ZG","Many lines of evidence indicate that minority and low-income populations are often exposed to unequal share of environmental hazards in their communities.

Race and income moderate the effect of parks on housing prices in a segregated city,"Castillo-Castillo, A.; Walker, R.; Keeler, B.; Lonsdorf, E.; Ramer, H.","Parks provide environmental and recreational services to urban areas, and are valuable for human health and social cohesion. Current literature demonstrates the positive influence of urban parks on property values. This work, which typically examines the relationship between proximity or quality of parks and surrounding property values, assumes the value of park attributes is not influenced by neighborhood context. However, there is a gap in understanding how the value of park attributes varies across neighborhoods with different socio-economic and racial demographics, particularly in highly segregated cities. Using spatial data on park attributes, home values, and neighborhood demographics in the Twin-Cities area in the United States, we investigated how willingness to pay for park characteristics vary by neighborhood income and race characteristics. Some park attributes such as tree canopy and the presence of a dog park had positive and significant impacts on property values across neighborhoods of varying race and income characteristics, whereas park size, bike trail access, and presence of water bodies in parks had positive or negative effects on property values depending on race and income of the surrounding neighborhoods. Our analysis helps to understand how park investments in neighborhoods of varying race and income may differentially affect housing market dynamics with theoretical and practical implications for addressing green gentrification. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",2025,Landscape and Urban Planning,259,,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2025.105340,#582,Castillo-Castillo 2025,"Castillo-Castillo et al., 2025",Yes,Yes,Aggregated,non-White/POC,,,,,,,,
"Environmental Justice and Phoenix, Arizona Neighborhood Parks","Corley, E.A.","The literature on urban parks and green spaces has demonstrated that these spaces in a city can have a significant and positive impact on human health, including physical, mental, and psychological health. In fact, living near parks has been shown to reduce mortality rates in residents and significantly reduce depression and stress levels. Yet, the environmental justice literature has shown that the quality of parks (measured by a variety of variables including park size) is not evenly distributed within metropolitan areas. Lower socio-economic status (SES) neighborhoods tend to have access to poorer quality parks than residents in higher SES areas. Some researchers have even shown how health disparities in cities (across a variety of SES variables) could be partly explained by reduced access to high-quality greenspace. In this article, EJSCREEN data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are merged with park data from the City of Phoenix to explore whether neighborhood parks in the City of Phoenix display these trends from the environmental justice literature. These trends are analyzed across a variety of demographic variables, including income level and percentage of under-represented residents.

"Evaluating Urban Green Space Inequity to Promote Distributional Justice in Portland, Oregon","Elderbrock, E.; Russel, K.; Ko, Y.; Budd, E.; Gonen, L.; Enright, C.","Access and exposure to urban green space—the combination of parks and vegetative cover in cities—are associated with various health benefits. As urban green space is often unequally distributed throughout cities, understanding how it is allocated across socio-demographic populations can help city planners and policy makers identify and address urban environmental justice and health equity issues. To our knowledge, no studies have yet combined assessments of park quality, park availability, and green cover to inform equitable urban green space planning. To this end, we developed a comprehensive methodology to identify urban green space inequities at the city scale and applied it in Portland, OR, USA. After auditing all public parks in Portland and gathering green cover data from publicly accessible repositories, we used a suite of statistical tests to evaluate distribution of parks and green cover across Census block groups, comprising race, ethnicity, income, and educational attainment characteristics. Right-of-way tree canopy cover was the most significant urban green space inequity identified in bivariate analysis (r<inf>s</inf> = −0.73). Spatial autoregressive models identified that right-of-way, private, and overall tree canopy cover (Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = 0.66, 0.77, and 0.67, respectively) significantly decreased with the proportion of minoritized racial population and increased with median income. The results were then used to identify priority locations for specific urban green space investments.

"The equity of urban forest change and frequency in Toronto, ON","Fleming, A.; Steenberg, J.","Urban forests provide a myriad of social, environmental, and economic benefits that help make cities desirable and safe places to live. However, despite their importance, urban forests are often inequitably distributed, with marginalized populations having disproportionately low access to them and their associated benefits. For this reason, understanding the distribution and change of urban forests is key to achieving their equitable presence and management. Though urban forest equity is becoming a well researched topic, few studies address the equity of urban forest change and most existing equity studies assess only canopy cover. This study addresses these gaps by examining the relationship between changes in Toronto's urban forest over a ten-year period and its frequency with four indicators of population marginalization. Diameter growth rate, mortality rate, and establishment rate were used to quantify change, while basal area per hectare and stems per hectare were used to quantify frequency. The indicators of marginalization used in this study were residential instability, economic dependency, ethnocultural composition and situational vulnerability, from the Canadian Index of Multiple Deprivation. Bivariate correlation, multiple linear regression, and geographically weighted regression were used to determine if there was a relationship between each urban forest variable and each indicator of marginalization. Bivariate cluster analysis was also used to identify areas in Toronto with the highest occurrences of urban forest inequity. Significant correlations are found between several indicators of marginalization with diameter growth rates, establishment rates, and both frequency measures. Furthermore, areas in Toronto with the highest establishment rates were also the areas with the highest tree frequency before this change analysis. Ultimately, this study suggests that changes in Toronto's urban forest are not helping to resolve its inequity, but reveals that understanding urban forest change can provide insights into potential perpetrators of existing inequities that may help cities address them. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH",2023,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,90,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2023.128153,#2194,Fleming 2023,"Fleming & Steenberg, 2023",Yes,Yes,Aggregated,CIMD Situational Vulnerability,,,,,,,,
"Using an environmental justice approach to examine the relationships between park availability and quality indicators, neighborhood disadvantage, and racial/ethnic composition","Hughey, SM; Walsemann, KM; Child, S; Powers, A; Reed, JA; Kaczynski, AT","Public parks are key community resources that can promote health. Some research has examined whether parks are equitably dispersed across neighborhoods of varying socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic composition, but few studies have examined the interaction of these characteristics. Additionally, the quality of park environments has received limited attention, but is considered integral to utilization of parks. This study examined the relationship between neighborhood disadvantage and park availability and quality and whether neighborhood racial/ethnic composition moderated these associations. A neighborhood disadvantage index was created for all block groups (n=255) in a southeastern U.S. county using Census Bureau data. Detailed audits of all public parks were conducted in 2013 (n=103). Park availability was determined using ArcGIS and four park quality indicators were examined: facilities, amenities, incivilities, and aesthetics. No significant differences were detected between neighborhood disadvantage and number of parks. However, high-disadvantaged neighborhoods had increased park incivilities compared to low-disadvantaged neighborhoods (IRR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.24,3.00). Further, neighborhood racial/ethnic composition moderated the associations between park incivilities and amenities and neighborhood disadvantage. Among low-disadvantaged neighborhoods, park incivilities increased as neighborhood minority concentration increased but remained constant in high-disadvantaged neighborhoods. Additionally, among low-disadvantaged neighborhoods, the number of park amenities decreased as neighborhood minority concentration increased but among high-disadvantaged neighborhoods, park amenities increased as neighborhood minority concentration increased. Identifying and rectifying disparities in park quality may be integral to creating equitable park environments across diverse neighborhoods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We studied how walkable urban form varies by neighborhood sociodemographic composition, region, and urbanicity across the United States. Using linear regression models and 2000-2001 US Census data, we investigated the relationship between 5 neighborhood census characteristics (income, education, racial/ethnic composition, age distribution, and sex) and 5 walkability indicators in almost 65,000 census tracts in 48 states and the District of Columbia. Data on the built environment were obtained from the RAND Corporation's (Santa Monica, California) Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (median block length, street segment, and node density) and the US Geological Survey's National Land Cover Database (proportion open space and proportion highly developed). Disadvantaged neighborhoods and those with more educated residents were more walkable (i.e., shorter block length, greater street node density, more developed land use, and higher density of street segments). However, tracts with a higher proportion of children and older adults were less walkable (fewer street nodes and lower density of street segments), after adjustment for region and level of urbanicity.

Biodiversity of Accessible Greenspace for Vulnerable Population Groups: Citizen Science Data Analysis,"Kirilenko, A.","Accessible greenspace biodiversity is a crucial element for human wellbeing. In this study, we explore the connection between social vulnerability, accessibility to greenspaces, and biodiversity in urban areas. To achieve this, we utilize citizen science data on public greenspace and species identification. Our findings reveal that areas with high population vulnerability generally have shorter distances to greenspaces. This unexpected result can be attributed to the inclusion of informal greenspaces in our analysis. However, the biodiversity of greenspaces accessible to vulnerable communities tends to be lower. This relationship varies across regions, with some areas showing improved access to high biodiversity spaces for vulnerable populations. This positive outcome can be attributed to revegetation efforts. Our study emphasizes the significance of considering biodiversity when assessing greenspace accessibility.

However, most studies restricted their analyses to a single or handful of cities and used diﬀerent natural environment measures. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether natural environments are inequitably distributed based on socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity in the contiguous United States. METHODS: We obtained SES and race/ethnicity data (2015-2019) for all U.S. Census tracts. For each tract, we calculated the Normalized Diﬀerent Vegetation Index (NDVI) for 2020, NatureScore (a proprietary measure of the quantity and quality of natural elements) for 2019, park cover for 2020, and blue space for 1984-2018. We used generalized additive models with adjustment for potential confounders and spatial autocorrelation to evaluate associations of SES and race/ethnicity with NDVI, NatureScore, park cover, and odds of containing blue space in all tracts (n = 71,532) and in urban tracts (n = 45,338). To compare eﬀect estimates, we standardized NDVI, NatureScore, and park cover so that beta coeﬃcients presented a percentage increase or decrease of the standard deviation (SD). RESULTS: Tracts with higher SES had higher NDVI, NatureScore, park cover, and odds of containing blue space. For example, urban tracts in the highest median household income quintile had higher NDVI [44.8% of the SD (95% CI: 42.8, 46.8)] and park cover [16.2% of the SD (95% CI: 13.5, 19.0)] com-pared with urban tracts in the lowest median household income quintile. Across all tracts, a lower percentage of non-Hispanic White individuals and a higher percentage of Hispanic individuals were associated with lower NDVI and NatureScore. In urban tracts, we observed weak positive associations between percentage non-Hispanic Black and NDVI, NatureScore, and park cover; we did not ﬁnd any clear associations for percentage Hispanics.

Racial inequalities in urban tree canopy exposure across major cities in the United States,"Li, W.; Li, C.","Urban tree canopy (UTC) offers vital ecosystem services and social benefits, yet unequal access, particularly for marginalized racial groups, remains a pressing environmental justice concern. Existing studies on UTC, however, are often city-specific and lack quantitative measures of racial inequality, limiting the generalizability of findings and the formulation of evidence-based environmental justice interventions. In this study, we conduct a nationwide analysis across 370 major U.S. cities, employing a population-weighted model to assess racial disparities in UTC exposure and applying the Kolm-Pollak equally distributed equivalent (EDE) metric to quantify city-level inequality. We find that White residents have the highest UTC exposure (23.7 %) and Hispanic residents the lowest (13.6 %). Notably, while Black residents exhibit a relative advantage in UTC exposure (22.1 %) at the national level, they face the most severe inequalities at the city level, requiring an average 2.69 % canopy increase to attain neighborhood-level benefits equivalent to those of White residents. Our results indicate that racial inequality in UTC exposure exists in nearly 90 % of the sampled cities, with White–minority gaps in UTC exceeding 10 % in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions. Additionally, racial composition accounts for 13 % of the variance in canopy coverage at the city level. The racial effect remains statistically significant after controlling for socio-economic and other potential confounders.

Invasive pests and pathogens as potential drivers of urban forest distributional inequalities and inequities,"Martin, A.J.F.; Conway, T.M.","Environmental injustices are influenced by socio-political and environmental legacies. Urban forest inequalities and inequities are often attributed to drivers like systemic racism and segregation. However, in recent decades, invasive pests and pathogens have substantially changed urban forests. It is not known how these invasive pests and pathogens act as a driver of urban forest inequalities and inequities. At the western range of Dutch elm disease (Ophiostoma spp.) and emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), we examined how the loss of localized street tree monocultures of elm (Ulmus spp.) and ash (Fraxinus spp.) will result in changes to distributional justice. We examined street tree count and basal area distributions, applying the Gini Index and spatial autoregression to measure inequality and inequity, respectively, under current conditions and hypothetical pest-induced loss scenarios. Findings reveal that DED-related elm losses could improve distributional equality, likely due to the high density of elm in already greener areas, while EAB-related losses of ash could increase inequalities. Street tree losses to both DED and EAB dampen the magnitude of distributional inequities, but the inequities remain present in areas of high residential instability, economic dependency, and ethno-cultural composition. Our results indicate that pest-induced urban forest losses do not merely reduce canopy cover but may reshape distributional equality and equity in ways that align with socioeconomic disparities. This research highlights the need to incorporate principles of environmental justice in pest management approaches and replanting efforts, particularly prioritizing systemically marginalized communities. These findings underscore the critical role of diversity and strategic planning in urban forest resilience, advocating for practices that mitigate the social and ecological impacts of invasive pests and pathogens. © 2025",2025,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,104,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2025.128671,#929,Martin 2025,"Martin & Conway, 2025",Yes,Yes,Aggregated,CIMD Situational Vulnerability,,,,,,,,

The uneven distribution of environmental burdens and benefits in Silicon Valley's backyard,"Stewart, IT; Bacon, CM; Burke, WD","Inequalities in the exposure to environmental burdens and access to environmental benefits are an environmental justice concern for urban and regional environmental planning. Recent studies have assessed the exposure of different populations to a combination of environmental hazards through GIS-based Cumulative Environmental Impact Assessments (CEIA). The contribution of this study is the development of a CEIA, which incorporates the distance-based impact of transportation, the cumulative impact of environmental hazards, and access to environmental benefits for Santa Clara County (SCC), a highly diverse and rapidly developing region also known as 'Silicon Valley'. Our results show that social vulnerability, cumulative environmental hazards, and environmental benefits exhibit distinct spatial patterns in SCC. High environmental hazard values are found along freeway and railroad corridors with substantial industrial legacies, while environmental benefit scores are generally higher in the suburban periphery. Correlations indicate that socially vulnerable populations in SCC are predominantly hispanic and are more likely to be exposed to environmental hazards, while white and wealthier populations are more likely to have access to environmental benefits.

Association of Neighborhood Racial and Ethnic Composition and Historical Redlining with Built Environment Indicators Derived from Street View Images in the US,"Yang, Y.; Cho, A.; Nguyen, Q.; Nsoesie, E.O.","Importance: Racist policies (such as redlining) create inequities in the built environment, producing racially and ethnically segregated communities, poor housing conditions, unwalkable neighborhoods, and general disadvantage. Studies on built environment disparities are usually limited to measures and data that are available from existing sources or can be manually collected. Objective: To use built environment indicators generated from online street-level images to investigate the association among neighborhood racial and ethnic composition, the built environment, and health outcomes across urban areas in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted using built environment indicators derived from 164 million Google Street View images collected from November 1 to 30, 2019. Race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic data were obtained from the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates; health outcomes were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020 Population Level Analysis and Community Estimates (PLACES) data set. Multilevel modeling and mediation analysis were applied. A total of 59231 urban census tracts in the US were included. The online images and the ACS data included all census tracts. The PLACES data comprised survey respondents 18 years or older. Data were analyzed from May 23 to November 16, 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Model-estimated association between image-derived built environment indicators and census tract (neighborhood) racial and ethnic composition, and the association of the built environment with neighborhood racial composition and health. Results: The racial and ethnic composition in the 59231 urban census tracts was 1160595 (0.4%) American Indian and Alaska Native, 53321345 (19.5%) Hispanic, 462259 (0.2%) Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 17166370 (6.3%) non-Hispanic Asian, 35985480 (13.2%) non-Hispanic Black, and 158043260 (57.7%) non-Hispanic White residents. Compared with other neighborhoods, predominantly White neighborhoods had fewer dilapidated buildings and more green space indicators, usually associated with good health, and fewer crosswalks (eg, neighborhoods with predominantly minoritized racial or ethnic groups other than Black residents had 6% more dilapidated buildings than neighborhoods with predominantly White residents). Moreover, the built environment indicators partially mediated the association between neighborhood racial and ethnic composition and health outcomes, including diabetes, asthma, and sleeping problems. The most significant mediator was non-single family homes (a measure associated with homeownership), which mediated the association between neighborhoods with predominantly minority racial or ethnic groups other than Black residents and sleeping problems by 12.8% and the association between unclassified neighborhoods and asthma by 24.2%. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings in this cross-sectional study suggest that large geographically representative data sets, if used appropriately, may provide novel insights on racial and ethnic health inequities.

This study addresses this research gap and answers the research question: How does highway segregation relate to differences in the different aspects of social vulnerability in influencing park access across Austin’s east–west divide? SafeGraph mobility data from 2019 and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), which included four themes (i.e., socioeconomic status, household composition, minority status and language, and housing and transportation characteristics), were analyzed through fixed-effects regression models for Austin, Texas. Results show that household composition and minority vulnerabilities have negative associations with park visitation, indicating that areas with more elderly, single-parent, or minority residents visit parks less frequently. Interaction terms reveal that highway segregation functions as a structural barrier that conditions the influence of social vulnerability on park use. Those associated with socioeconomic resources diminish, while the disadvantages linked to household composition and minority status intensify on the east side of I-35, reflecting the cumulative effects of segregation and infrastructural division. These findings confirm that inequities in park access are more pronounced on the east side of the I-35, consistent with the highway’s role in reinforcing segregation. Efforts to strengthen connectivity represent key strategies for advancing equitable park visitation across Austin. © 2025 by the authors.",2025,Urban Science,9,12,,10.3390/urbansci9120512,#125,Yoon 2025,"Yoon et al., 2025",Yes,Yes,Aggregated,Minority status and language,,,,,,,,
Using multiple disparate data sources to map heat vulnerability: Vancouver case study,"Aminipouri, M.; Knudby, A.; Ho, H.C.","Extreme heat events have caused excess mortality in Canadian cities. In order to map the population groups most vulnerable to extreme heat in Vancouver, we overlaid multiple layers of socio-economic, environmental, and infrastructural data. By superimposing multiple disparate data layers, we were able to detect and visualize 105 socio-economically deprived dissemination areas with high vulnerability to extreme heat events. The three dissemination areas found to be most vulnerable to heat varied from the rest of the sample in terms of environmental and infrastructural variables. These three vulnerable dissemination areas also have relatively low vegetation cover as well as relatively hot surface temperatures. As such, they are socio-economically vulnerable, far from cooling and health infrastructure, and have an environment that elevates heat exposure. Our results are a preliminary step toward the development of tools that can help health authorities, city officials, and policymakers better understand who is at risk during extreme heat events, where they reside, what factors drive the risk, and ultimately what can be done to mitigate it.

Development of a Geographic Information Systems Mapping Tool to Measure Park Equity in Maryland,"Bara, S.R.; Ejedoghaobi, U.; Archer, J.-M.J.; Adegun, A.; Han, R.; Stewart, K.; Wilson, S.","In 2008, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) developed the Maryland Park Equity Assessment Tool to visualize the socioenvironmental distribution of parks across the state and assess where resource investments would most enhance residents’ access to green space. This tool, the first of its kind in Maryland (MD), represents an important advancement in environmental justice (EJ) decision making. In 2018, MDNR partnered with the authors to update the tool’s rudimentary model for identifying communities with low park equity and to improve the tool’s overall function and design. The updated tool scores census block groups (CBGs) in MD based on the following nine factors: population density, concentration of households <185% of the federal poverty line, concentration of children under the age of 18 years, concentration of adults 65+, concentration of non-White households, distance to public park space, distance to public transportation, and walkability, and linguistic isolation. This article provides details and rationale regarding the indicators and formula used to assign park equity scores to each CBG. The details of added user-driven functions are also described.

Inequality in heat: The role of spatial patterns of urban green infrastructure,"Chen, P.","Focusing on the inequity of heat distribution and the influence of spatial patterns of urban green infrastructure (UGI) on this distribution, this study used bootstrapping bivariate Pearson's correlation to examine the relationship between sociodemographic variables at the census tract level and land surface temperature. The study assessed the performance of multiple models and utilized the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees model to investigate the effects of UGI spatial patterns on thermal environments. Additionally, this study explored how the spatial patterns of UGI differ among sociodemographic groups and their role in heat inequality. The findings revealed consistent heat disparities among certain population groups. The UGI area and patch density exhibited generalized nonlinear effects on urban thermal environments, whereas more fragmented distribution of UGI patches, along with inadequate provision, implicated higher temperatures in marginalized communities. Therefore, it is crucial to adopt a context-specific strategy to address urban heat inequity effectively. Improving the spatial patterns of UGI and increasing UGI coverage in marginalized communities can help mitigate heat distribution inequities. © 2023",2024,Urban Climate,53,,,10.1016/j.uclim.2024.101820,#2084,Chen 2024,"Chen, 2024",Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,
Ecological and developmental history impacts the equitable distribution of services,"Darling, L.E.; Rollinson, C.R.; Fahey, R.T.; Morzillo, A.T.; Johnson, L.R.; Baker, M.; Aronson, M.F.J.; Hardiman, B.S.","The ecological and developmental history of the Chicago, Illinois, region has affected the current distribution of forests therein. These same factors, along with systemic and long-lasting racial segregation, have shaped the distribution of the urban populations that benefit from the ecosystem services provided by urban forests. This study demonstrates that forest patch history is related to forest attributes like tree species composition, tree density, canopy height, and structural heterogeneity—all of which are important predictors of a forest's ability to provide ecosystem services. However, this effect of forest history was only seen in forest cores, as forest edges were similar regardless of patch history. We also found that forests in minoritized communities tended to be less able to support high levels of ecosystem services. This research indicates that, when improving green equity, it is important to consider the variable capacity of forests to provide ecosystem services. © 2025 The Author(s).

A spatial analysis of the relationship between vegetation and poverty,"Dawson, T.; Onasimo Sandoval, J.S.; Sagan, V.; Crawford, T.","The goal of this paper was to investigate poverty and inequities that are associated with vegetation. First, we performed a pixel-level linear regression on time-series and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for 72 United States (U.S.) cities with a population ≥250,000 for 16 years (1990, 1991, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 2001 to 2010) using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer 1-kilometer (1-km). Second, from the pixel-level regression, we selected five U.S. cities (Shrinking: Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Growing: Dallas and Tucson) that were one standard deviation above the overall r-squared mean and one standard deviation below the overall r-squared mean to show cities that were different from the typical cities. Finally, we used spatial statistics to investigate the relationship between census tract level data (i.e., poverty, population, and race) and vegetation for 2010, based on the 1-km grid cells using Ordinary Least Squares Regression and Geographically Weighted Regression. Our results revealed poverty related areas were significantly correlated with positive high and/or negative high vegetation in both shrinking and growing cities.

More than greening: Using a novel index to assess restorative nature and vulnerability relationships,"Devisscher, T.; Lam, T.; Fitzgibbons, J.; Jarvis, I.; Li, D.; Mitchell, M.G.E.","Urban living limits access to nature yet spending time in nature is crucial for human health and well-being. To overcome this, urban planners and policymakers are actively looking for different ways to conserve and create more urban nature through parks, street trees, and other greening strategies. However, research shows that in most cities, these greening efforts are not equitably distributed, nor are they equal in terms of their quality or benefits they provide. Creating more equitable access to urban nature is a challenge and a priority in the next decade, and so is improving the quality of urban nature and associated benefits for urbanites. To address this challenge and contribute at both practical and conceptual levels, we propose a new Local Restorative Nature (LRN) index for geospatially assessing the “restorative quality” of urban nature that can support mental well-being. To contextualize the LRN index, we map the distribution of restorative nature in relation to social vulnerability in Vancouver, Canada. The novel LRN index provides critical insights showing that many neighborhoods with vulnerable populations in Vancouver have less exposure to restorative nature to support mental health and highlights where to strategically prioritize urban greening investment in areas that need it the most. The LRN index is scalable and can be used by urban planners in other cities and contexts to improve equitable distribution of restorative nature and better support urbanites’ well-being. © 2023, Crown.",2023,Ambio,52,12,1992-2008,10.1007/s13280-023-01889-2,#2222,Devisscher 2023,"Devisscher et al., 2023",Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,
Comparative analysis of greenery inequalities in New York and London: Social-economic and spatial dimensions,"Hu, Y.; Chen, M.; Cai, Y.","With the rapid development of urbanization, the reduction of urban green spaces (UGS) has negatively impacted residents' quality of life and environmental quality. Recognizing that factors influencing environmental justice vary across different national and city contexts, this study aims to explore these differential impacts. However, most existing studies focus on single cities or specific regions, with limited comparative research between different countries. To explore the factors that differentially affect UGS in various cities, this study compares the distribution of UGS in New York City, U.S., and London, UK, investigating socio-economic variables (percentage of population in poverty, housing-cost burden, education level), demographic factors (proportion of minorities, elderly, individuals with disabilities), and built-environment indicators (residential density, road density, land-use types). These variables are measured using official census data and spatial datasets from each city, ensuring robust coverage of community vulnerability and development intensity. The research employs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) methods to analyze the relationship between UGS. The OLS results indicate that in both New York and London, minority and elderly populations have a positive correlation with UGS usage, while low-income groups face greater inequalities. GWR and MGWR reveal that UGS inequalities are mainly concentrated in urban peripheries or economically weaker areas. Notably, New York is more affected by economic factors, showing significant spatial heterogeneity in economically underdeveloped areas. These findings are significant for developing more equitable and effective UGS policies. Such methods enable systematic evaluations across different countries based on case studies from major cities, breaking down regional isolation and fostering more equitable and effective UGS policies globally. Understanding these differences can lead to more targeted interventions, improve the quality of life for vulnerable groups, and promote sustainable urban development worldwide. © 2025 The Authors",2025,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,112,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2025.128939,#410,Hu 2025,"Hu et al., 2025",Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,
"Latino Park Access: Examining Environmental Equity in a ""New Destination"" County in the South","Johnson-Gaither, C","This paper examines Latino migration to a ""new destination"" county in the southeastern U.S., Hall County, Georgia, where environmental equity is considered in terms of Latino communities' walking access to public and private parks in the county. Park access is considered an environmental equity or justice issue because some research shows less park acreage available to minority and immigrant communities, compared to communities where residents are mostly white and U.S. born. Given that much Latino settlement in the county has occurred in working class, majority white neighborhoods, I examine the amount of parkland acreage that, in 2000, was adjacent to neighborhoods with significant Latino, white, and African American populations. Findings show that formerly working class white communities contained considerably fewer park acres than more affluent, mostly white communities elsewhere in the county. Consequentially, Latinos moving into these areas had access to little park acreage relative to amounts available in the county. Results suggest that Latinos must live in more integrated, middle-and upper-income neighborhoods to access a greater amount of parkland acreage. Information from this study can be used to help inform park planning at the municipal and county levels, with a particular focus on improving access for the county's Latino populations. Latino settlement is confined largely to two centralcity (Gainesville, Georgia) census tracts where the amount of land available for park conversion is extremely limited. White settlement, on the other hand, extends to the outlying suburbs with more potentially convertible land. Possible strategies to address the relative lack of parkland in higher density Latino communities include converting land from existing uses such as abandoned landfills, rail yards or lines to park acreage; or the establishment of land sharing initiatives whereby neighborhood residents use schoolyards or even cemeteries for recreation. The larger task, however, for city leaders and community organizers is to involve the affected citizenry in decisions about parkland conversion; as Harnik (2010) argues, the most effective strategies for increasing park acreage involve grassroots, political engagement. Indeed, procedural justice, or the participation of nonwhite, minority, and poor communities in decisions about the production and distribution of both environmental burdens and goods (park resources) is a central tenant of environmental equity.",2011,JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION,29,4,37-52,,#7533,Johnson-Gaither 2011,"Johnson-Gaither, 2011",Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,
Tree diversity across the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area in relation to climate and social vulnerability,"Keller, AB; Brandt, LA; Cavender-Bares, J; Knight, JF; Hobbie, SE","Urban tree canopy cover is often unequally distributed across cities such that more socially vulnerable neighborhoods often have lower tree canopy cover than less socially vulnerable neighborhoods. However, how the diversity and composition of the urban canopy affect the nature of social-ecological benefits (and burdens), including the urban forest's vulnerability to climate change, remains underexamined. Here, we synthesize tree inventories developed by multiple organizations and present a species-specific, geolocated database of more than 600,000 urban trees across the 7-county Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) metropolitan area in the Upper Midwest of the United States. We find that tree diversity across the MSP is variable yet dominated by a few species (e.g., Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Acer platanoides, and Gleditsia triacanthos), contributing to the vulnerability of the MSP urban forest to future climate change and disturbances. In contrast to tree canopy cover, tree diversity was not well predicted by socioeconomic or demographic factors. However, our analysis identified areas where both climate and social vulnerability are high.

Urban Park Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Are Socially Vulnerable Communities Disproportionately Impacted?,"Larson, L.R.; Zhang, Z.; Oh, J.I.; Beam, W.; Ogletree, S.; Bocarro, J.N.; Lee, K.J.; Casper, J.; Stevenson, K.T.; Hipp, J.A.; Mullenbach, L.E.; Carusona, M.; Wells, M.","The COVID-19 pandemic altered human behavior around the world. To maintain mental and physical health during periods of lockdown and quarantine, people often engaged in outdoor, physically distanced activities such as visits to parks and greenspace. However, research tracking outdoor recreation patterns during the pandemic has yielded inconsistent results, and few studies have explored the impacts of COVID-19 on park use across diverse neighborhoods. We used a mixed methods approach to examine changes in park use patterns in cities across North Carolina, USA, during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an emphasis on impacts in socially vulnerable communities (based on racial/ethnic composition and socioeconomic status). First, we surveyed a demographically representative sample of 611 urban residents during August 2020 to assess their use of outdoor park spaces before and during the pandemic. Second, we used cell phone location (i.e., geo-tracking) data to document changes in park visits within 605 socioeconomically diverse urban census tracts before (July 2019) and during (July 2020) the pandemic. Data from both methods revealed urban park use declined during the pandemic; 56% of survey respondents said they stopped or reduced park use, and geo-tracked park visits dropped by 15%. Park users also became more homogenous, with visits increasing the most for past park visitors and declining the most in socially vulnerable communities and among individuals who were BIPOC or lower-income. Our results raise concerns about urban park use during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest pre-existing health disparities in socially vulnerable communities might be exacerbated by inequitable access and utilization of parks and greenspace. © © 2021 Larson, Zhang, Oh, Beam, Ogletree, Bocarro, Lee, Casper, Stevenson, Hipp, Mullenbach, Carusona and Wells.",2021,Frontiers in Sustainable Cities,3,,,10.3389/frsc.2021.710243,#3468,Larson 2021,"Larson et al., 2021",Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,

It is vital to ensure urban parks serve the communities equally, particularly during the pandemic and for traditionally disadvantaged groups. This study examined how the COVID-19 pandemic changed urban dwellers' visitation patterns to urban parks and assessed whether the pandemic exacerbated the inequalities of urban park access among different sociodemographic groups in the U.S. We investigated urban dwellers' visitation patterns from two aspects (origin and destination) and used a big data approach by integrating mobility data from mobile devices, remote sensing/geospatial data, socioeconomic data, etc. This study found urban dwellers preferred visiting urban parks that were remoter, larger, greener, less crowded, less noisy, and with less human activities during the pandemic (i.e., 2020 and 2021) vs. pre-pandemic (i.e., 2019). Our results also highlighted that the pandemic exacerbated social inequalities in urban park access. The urban dwellers from block groups with higher percentages of racial/ethnic minorities, higher unemployment and poverty rates, and lower income were more negatively influenced by the pandemic and became less likely to visit urban parks.

Equitable distribution of green stormwater infrastructure: a capacity-based framework for implementation in disadvantaged communities,"Mandarano, L.; Meenar, M.","This study seeks to understand the factors that influence the variability in distribution of public and private sector investments in green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) projects across the diversity of neighbourhoods in the City of Philadelphia, PA, U.S.A. using indicators of community context and capacity. For this study, context is defined as characteristics of disadvantaged communities and capacity as factors that facilitate individual and collective action. Community context and capacity are deemed integral to the success of the Philadelphia GSI programme as the Philadelphia Water Department is relying upon collaborative approaches to facilitate public investments in neighbourhoods and voluntary implementation of GSI practices on publically and privately owned lands. Private sector investments in GSI mandated by stormwater regulations for new construction and major rehabilitation also are assessed in relation to these two sets of indicators. The geographic information systems and statistical analyses reveal an inequitable distribution of GSI projects, which largely is driven by market forces.

Racial Disparities in Access to Public Green Spaces: Using Geographic Information Systems to Identify Underserved Populations in a Small American City,"Miller, E.B.; Seyfried, A.P.; Pender, S.E.; Heard, K.; Meindl, G.A.","Green spaces are integral components of urban environments, as they provide numerous health benefits to people. However, urban green spaces are often inequitably distributed. Understanding the relationship between green space access and socioeconomic status is critical for identifying and eliminating environmental injustices. This study utilized Geographic Information Systems to examine the relationship between green space accessibility and racial groups in Binghamton, New York, a small city with known socioeconomic disparities and public health concerns. Using network analysis to measure distances of census blocks from green spaces, we found that most neighborhoods, regardless of overall minority composition, have equitable access to green spaces when considering all green spaces. However, when increasing the minimum threshold to 5000 m2 green spaces, the standard used by the World Health Organization to define high-quality green space, we found that low-Asian census blocks have significantly less access to green spaces, whereas high-Hispanic blocks have relatively greater access to green space. This underscores the importance of considering each racial category separately rather than lumping people of color into a single category, which is common practice in studies of social inequity. Our results highlight disparities between access to green space across different racial groups in a small-sized American city and can be used by urban planners to inform future initiatives that value social equity. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2022,Environmental Justice,15,4,246-256,10.1089/env.2021.0067,#2998,Miller 2022,"Miller et al., 2022",Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,

The metric is calculated by measuring the shortest distance between any location and the nearest built environment using a Geographic Information System. The metric is illustrated using two counties of the greater Twin Cities Metropolitan Region of Minnesota.

"The Spatial Patterns of Pluvial Flood Risk, Blue-Green Infrastructure, and Social Vulnerability: A Case Study from Two Alaskan Cities","Pallathadka, A.K.; Chang, H.; Ajibade, I.","Flooding is a serious form of natural hazard in Alaska, USA. Two of Alaska's biggest cities, Anchorage and Fairbanks, have experienced flooding of varying magnitude since the cities were first settled in the early 20th century. Although flood mitigation measures such as blue-green infrastructure (BGI) are rising in prominence, the spatial relationship of BGI, urban pluvial flood (UPF) zone, and social vulnerability remains understudied. This study delineates the UPF zone of Anchorage and Fairbanks using the Blue Spot modeling and correlates it with the distribution of BGI at Census Block Group (CBG) scale, focusing on underlying social vulnerability using a set of indicators. Anchorage shows a positive correlation (r = 0.53, p < 0.01) between percentage of UPF area and density of BGF, whereas Fairbanks shows an insignificant negative correlation. In Anchorage, more socially vulnerable CBGs (n = 10) intersect with high blue spot CBGs (n = 33), compared to Fairbanks where those numbers are 1:6. The results indicate that while BGI is equitably and proportionally distributed within the Anchorage UPF zone, the same is not true in Fairbanks, where distribution is equitable, but not proportionate to pluvial flood risk. The study emphasizes that both types of distribution present their unique challenges and opportunities, but the relative absence of BGI increases flood risk for residents. The results are useful for spatial planners to better inform flood mitigation strategies in urban areas, especially to reduce the gap between equitable and proportional distribution of BGI. © 2021 Korea-America Association for Geospatial and Environmental Sciences.

Transit to parks: An environmental justice study of transit access to large parks in the U.S. West,"Park, K.; Rigolon, A.; Choi, D.-A.; Lyons, T.; Brewer, S.","Large parks—including regional parks, state parks, and national forests and parks—have particular health, social, and environmental benefits. Thus, promoting equal access to large parks is increasingly becoming a goal of environmental justice activists, planners, and policymakers. Disadvantaged populations (e.g., low-income people of color) have worse walking access to large parks than more privileged groups and might rely on public transportation to access such parks. But empirical studies on whether access to large parks via public transit is justly distributed are lacking. In this paper, we examine the relationship between a novel measure of public transit access to large parks (the T2P index) and neighborhood-level disadvantage (income, race/ethnicity, and age). Using network analysis with public transit feed data and park location data, we calculate the T2P index for every census block group in the 15 largest metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the U.S. West. We find some evidence of environmental injustice. A spatial filtering model shows that T2P access increases when a neighborhood has a larger share of non-Hispanic Whites and a smaller share of older adults, but that median household income is not associated with T2P in the entire sample. We also find that some regions present significant environmental injustices in T2P whereas others have fewer to no injustices. Transit agencies and park planners could use our T2P index and findings to prioritize transit investment for disadvantaged populations and promote healthy living. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH",2021,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,60,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127055,#3600,Park 2021,"Park et al., 2021",Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,

Findings illustrate amenities with over- or underrepresentation of visitors from certain socio-demographic groups, with bivariate analyses documenting intersectionality between race and income.

Do Urban Golf Courses Provide Barriers to Equitable Greenspace Access in the United States?,"Ryan, JC","Providing equitable access to greenspace requires innovative strategies in urban areas where land is scarce and expensive. One potential solution is to make golf courses, which are often exclusive and require daily or annual membership fees, more accessible to the general public. The impact of urban golf courses on greenspace access has yet to be investigated systematically, however. Here we quantify (1) the number and area of golf courses within all major urban areas in the conterminous United States, and (2) the number and demographics of people that would benefit from better access to them. We identify 6,962 urban golf courses that cover 3,102 km(2) urban land, equivalent to similar to 29 percent of all urban greenspace. We find that 3.4 percent of the U.S. urban population (equivalent to nearly 6 million people) live less than 1 km from a golf course but more than 1 km from public greenspace. Policies that make golf courses more available to the general public would substantially improve greenspace access, and associated health benefits, for millions of Americans. In most cities, however, it is wealthy, White neighborhoods that would benefit most from better access to golf courses, not the lower socioeconomic, ethno-racial minority communities that are most lacking in greenspace access.

Parks improve mental and physical health by nurturing social cohesion and enabling physical activity. So who gets parks? Park access has traditionally been evaluated using constructed variables of potential access: distances, buffers, and gravity models. These models have major limitations: they ignore commutes and other more intricate mobility behaviors. To address these issues, I propose a nationally scalable, empirical measure of realized use. Using a dataset of smartphone locations, I identify visits to parks in the 20 largest American cities. I use these data to calibrate existing models, and then contrast the models with realized use. The spatial models are not simply imprecise; they systematically over-estimate realized access by minority populations. In other words, they understate inequity. © 2020 The Ohio State University",2021,Geographical Analysis,53,4,665-685,10.1111/gean.12265,#3466,Saxon 2021,"Saxon, 2021",Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,
Got green? addressing environmental justice in park provision,"Sister, C.; Wolch, J.; Wilson, J.","We present a pragmatic approach to assist planners in addressing racial inequities in park access. Utilizing the Los Angeles metropolitan region as an example, we used Thiessen polygons to delineate a service area for each park, and described potential park congestion or 'pressure' in each park service area. Results show that Latinos, African-Americans, and low-income groups in general were likely to live close to parks with higher potential park congestion. On the other hand, predominantly White, high-income areas were typically located close to parks with lower potential park congestion levels. The park service area analysis presented here facilitates the identification of areas with greater park need and provides a pragmatic way to redress existing disparities in park access.

Assessing macro-scale patterns in urban tree canopy and inequality,"Volin, E.; Ellis, A.; Hirabayashi, S.; Maco, S.; Nowak, D.J.; Parent, J.; Fahey, R.T.","Urban forests provide a variety of ecosystem services that influence environmental and social welfare, but variable distribution of urban tree canopy (UTC) within and among urban areas can lead to inequitable provisioning of these benefits. Variation in UTC among and within urban areas is associated with local development patterns and socio-economic factors as well as broad-scale variation in the biophysical and socio-cultural context of urban regions. The objective of this study was to evaluate regional and continental trends in UTC distribution within and among urban areas, including assessing relationships of UTC and UTC inequality with socio-economic/demographic factors and characteristics of urban regions. Remotely-sensed UTC assessments and US Census data were used to derive census block group-level UTC-related response variables (e.g., percent UTC, inequality in UTC) and socio-economic/demographic predictor variables (e.g., median income, population density) for forty U.S. cities spanning several biophysical and socio-cultural regions. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze relationships of UTC with socio-economic/demographic predictor variables and the strength of these relationships was compared among cities across regions. There was a significant negative relationship (R2 = 0.45) between total UTC and UTC inequality across the 40 cities, as the equality of UTC distribution within cities increased with decreasing total UTC. There was significant variation across biophysical and socio-cultural regions in UTC, UTC inequality, and the strength of the correlation of fine scale UTC with socio-economic/demographic factors. These findings illustrate the important role of broad-scale biophysical and socio-cultural factors as drivers of UTC patterns within and among cities. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH",2020,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,55,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126818,#3876,Volin 2020,"Volin et al., 2020",Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,
"Making the City of Lakes: Whiteness, Nature, and Urban Development in Minneapolis","Walker, R.H.; Ramer, H.; Derickson, K.D.; Keeler, B.L.","Minneapolis has the twin distinctions of having one of the most highly rated park systems in the United States and some of the most pronounced racial disparities in wealth and homeownership. We argue that this coupling of urban nature and racial inequality was intentionally produced by the city’s real estate industry and local government. Drawing on Mapping Prejudice’s first complete metro-wide map of racial covenants—clauses in property deeds barring sale to anyone not considered white—we pair quantitative spatial analysis with archival research on turn-of-the century greening campaigns and local real estate practices. We use two developments, Nokomis Terrace and Walton Hills, as illustrative examples of the ways in which developers worked with civil society organizations and local government agencies to secure public investments in green amenities, including gardens and public parks, while blanketing their developments with racial covenants. To boost property values, developers paired “greenness” and legal guarantees of whiteness, engineering idealized nature while excluding racialized groups. The result was that 73 percent of park acreage added from 1910 to 1955, the period in which covenants were used in Minneapolis, had at least one racial covenant within 0.1 miles.

"Do urban form characteristics perpetuate disparities of pandemic-induced mobility changes? Evidence from Fulton County, Georgia","Wang, J.; Zha, Y.","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on urban mobility. While studies highlighted socioeconomic disparities, few have paid attention to the moderating role of the built environment in shaping those changes. To fill the gap, this paper investigates associations between the morphological features of the built environment and changes in population mobility patterns during the pandemic. We used SafeGraph's travel data to Point of Interest (POI) sampled from 2019 to 2021 in Fulton County, Georgia to quantify mobility patterns at the census tract level. Through Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis, we extracted four key urban form features: density, connectivity, diversity, and centrality from a list of 12 raw built environment variables. Results of the spatial lag regression model indicate a significant relationship between the built environment and mobility changes, that a more diverse, denser, and more connected built environment can mitigate disparities of the mobility pattern changes which are often associated with inequitable socioeconomic backgrounds. And urban forms with higher density and diversity can encourage trips to green spaces, benefiting residents’ mental and physical health during the pandemic. This research enhances the understanding of the relationship between the built environment and population mobility patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings are useful for urban planning and public health, in which particular attention should be paid to suburban low-income neighborhoods as the most vulnerable group facing both socioeconomic and built environment disparities in public health crises. In addition, higher densities and mixed-use developments can also serve as effective strategies for urban planners and designers to strengthen urban mobility resilience in the future. © 2024",2024,Travel Behaviour and Society,36,,,10.1016/j.tbs.2024.100803,#1705,Wang 2024,"Wang & Zha, 2024",Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,
"Urban green space access, social cohesion, and mental health outcomes before and during Covid-19","Wilson, B.; Neale, C.; Roe, J.","Physical activity offers significant mental health and social wellbeing benefits but social distancing and quarantine requirements during the pandemic along with disparities in access to parks and other urban green spaces limited the ability of some to pursue outdoor activities like recreational walking, jogging, or hiking. This paper asks: (1) how access to different types of urban green space varies by race and income, (2) how green space usage changed, and (3) how greenspace usage impacted mental health during the early phase of the pandemic. Using data from a household survey as well as anonymized GPS data generated by mobile devices, we explore these question in Richmond, Virginia. At the pandemic's onset, visits to green spaces declined regionally, but increased for low-income groups as a proportion of all visits. Structural equation modeling results suggest that mental health was directly influenced by social cohesion and race, with evidence of an indirect effect of greenspace usage on mental health through its impact on social cohesion. Social cohesion's effect on mental health was positive while respondents who identified as White were less likely to report positive mental health. We also find a strong, positive effect of greenspace use and satisfaction on social cohesion. © 2024 The Authors",2024,Cities,152,,,10.1016/j.cities.2024.105173,#1602,Wilson 2024,"Wilson et al., 2024",Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,
"Historical racial redlining and contemporary patterns of income inequality negatively affect birds, their habitat, and people in Los Angeles, California","Wood, EM; Esaian, S; Benitez, C; Ethington, PJ; Longcore, T; Pomara, LY","The Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) was a U.S. government-sponsored program initiated in the 1930s to evaluate mortgage lending risk. The program resulted in hand-drawn ""security risk"" maps intended to grade sections of cities where investment should be focused (greenlined areas) or limited (redlined zones). The security maps have since been widely criticized as being inherently racist and have been associated with high levels of segregation and lower levels of green amenities in cities across the country. Our goal was to explore the potential legacy effects of the HOLC grading practice on birds, their habitat, and the people who may experience them throughout a metropolis where the security risk maps were widely applied, Greater Los Angeles, California (L.A.). We used ground-collected, remotely sensed, and census data and descriptive and predictive modeling approaches to address our goal. Patterns of bird habitat and avian communities strongly aligned with the luxury-effect phenomenon, where green amenities were more robust, and bird communities were more diverse and abundant in the wealthiest parts of L.A. Our analysis also revealed potential legacy effects from the HOLC grading practice. Associations between bird habitat features and avian communities in redlined and greenlined zones were generally stronger than in areas of L.A. that did not experience the HOLC grading, in part because redlined zones, which included some of the poorest locations of L.A., had the highest levels of dense urban conditions (e.g., impervious surface cover), whereas greenlined zones, which included some of the wealthiest areas of the city, had the highest levels of green amenities (e.g., tree canopy cover). The White population of L.A., which constitutes the highest percentage of a racial or ethnic group in greenlined areas, was aligned with a considerably greater abundance of birds affiliated with natural habitat features (e.g., trees and shrubs). Conversely, the Hispanic or Latino population, which is dominant in redlined zones, was positively related to a significantly greater abundance of synanthropic birds, which are species associated with dense urban conditions. Our results suggest that historical redlining and contemporary patterns of income inequality are associated with distinct avifaunal communities and their habitat, which potentially influence the human experience of these components of biodiversity throughout L.A. Redlined zones and low-income residential areas that were not graded by the HOLC can particularly benefit from deliberate urban greening and habitat enhancement projects, which would likely carry over to benefit birds and humans.center dot Redlining was a racially biased investment and lending practice established in the 1930s and applied in 239 cities across the United States.center dot The program was terminated in 1968 but has since been linked with strong segregation of human communities, wealth, and green amenities in cities nationwide.center dot In Greater Los Angeles, California, redlining continues to be negatively related to avian community patterns, their habitat and the people who may experience them.center dot Luxury-effect patterns, where biodiversity is positively associated with affluence, largely predicted avifaunal patterns in Greater Los Angeles center dot Legacy-effect patterns due to historical redlining also showed strong relationships and patterns of bird habitat and community composition, suggesting the practice is potentially a powerful force structuring contemporary urban avifauna and human communities.center dot Careful yet deliberate action in urban greening could likely benefit birds and humans in redlined zones and other low-income areas of Greater Los Angeles.La Corporacion de Prestamos para Propietarios de Hogares (HOLC, por sus siglas en ingles) fue un programa patrocinado por el gobierno de EEUU, iniciado en la decada de 1930, para evaluar el riesgo en la concesion de hipotecas. El programa resulto en la creacion de mapas de ""riesgo de seguridad"" dibujados a mano, destinados a clasificar secciones de ciudades donde la inversion deberia centrarse (areas resaltadas en verde) o limitarse (zonas marcadas en rojo). Los mapas de seguridad han sido ampliamente criticados posteriormente por ser inherentemente racistas y se han asociado con altos niveles de segregacion y niveles mas bajos de comodidades verdes en ciudades de todo el pais. Nuestro objetivo fue explorar los posibles efectos heredados de la practica de calificacion de HOLC en las aves, su habitat y en las personas que podrian experimentarlos, en toda una metropolis donde los mapas de riesgo de seguridad se aplicaron ampliamente, el Gran Los angeles, California (L.A.). Utilizamos datos recopilados en el terreno, obtenidos de forma remota y censales, junto con enfoques descriptivos y de modelado predictivo, para abordar nuestro objetivo. Los patrones de habitat de las aves y de las comunidades de aves se alinearon fuertemente con el fenomeno del efecto de lujo, en el que las comodidades verdes fueron mas solidas y las comunidades de aves fueron mas diversas y abundantes en las partes mas ricas de L.A. Nuestro analisis tambien revelo posibles efectos heredados de la practica de calificacion de HOLC. Las asociaciones entre las caracteristicas del habitat de las aves y las comunidades de aves en las zonas marcadas en rojo y verde fueron generalmente mas fuertes que en las areas de L.A. que no experimentaron la calificacion de HOLC, en parte porque las zonas marcadas en rojo, que incluian algunas de las ubicaciones mas pobres de L.A., tuvieron los niveles mas altos de condiciones urbanas densas, como la cobertura de superficie impermeable, mientras que las zonas marcadas en verde, que incluian algunas de las areas mas ricas de la ciudad, tuvieron los niveles mas altos de comodidades verdes, como la cobertura de dosel arboreo. La poblacion blanca de L.A., que constituye el mayor porcentaje de un grupo racial o etnico en las areas resaltadas en verde, se correspondio con una abundancia considerablemente mayor de aves afiliadas a caracteristicas de habitat natural (e.g., arboles y arbustos). Por el contrario, la poblacion hispana o latina, que es dominante en las zonas marcadas en rojo, estuvo relacionada positivamente con una abundancia significativamente mayor de aves sinantropicas, que son especies asociadas con condiciones urbanas densas. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la discriminacion historica en la delimitacion de zonas y los patrones contemporaneos de desigualdad de ingresos estan asociados con comunidades de avifauna distintas y con sus habitats, lo que potencialmente influye en la experiencia humana de estos componentes de la biodiversidad en todo L.A. La delimitacion de zonas marcadas en rojo y las areas residenciales de bajos ingresos que no fueron calificadas por HOLC pueden beneficiarse especialmente de proyectos dirigidos al enverdecimiento urbano y a la mejora de habitat, que probablemente a su vez beneficiaran a las aves y los humanos.",2024,ORNITHOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,126,1,,10.1093/ornithapp/duad044,#6600,Wood 2024,"Wood et al., 2024",Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,
"Equally green? Understanding the distribution of urban green infrastructure across student demographics in four public school districts in North Carolina, USA","Zhang, Z.; Martin, K.L.; Stevenson, K.T.; Yao, Y.","Green infrastructure (GI) provides a suite of ecosystem services that are widely recognized as critical to health, well-being, and sustainability on an urbanizing planet. However, the distribution of GI across urban landscapes is frequently uneven, resulting in unequal delivery of these services to low-income residents or those belonging to underserved racial/ethnic identities. While GI distribution has been identified as unequal across municipalities, we investigated whether this was true in public schoolyards within and among urban school districts. We examined schoolyards in four metropolitan areas of diverse socio-economic and demographic compositions in North Carolina, USA to determine if they provided equal exposure to GI, then compared whether this was true of the broader urban landscape. We first classified the land cover of elementary schoolyards and their neighborhoods, then used bivariate and multivariate approaches to analyze the relationships between GI (i.e. tree canopy cover and total GI) and the socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity of the schools and surrounding neighborhoods, respectively. We found that the extent of tree canopy cover and total GI in schoolyards was unrelated to the socioeconomic status and the race/ethnicity of students across the four school districts. In contrast, neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic status and larger populations of underserved race/ethnicity residents had less tree canopy cover and total GI. Although total GI was more evenly distributed in schoolyards, the extent of tree canopy cover and total GI in schoolyards was lower than that in the neighborhoods. This suggests opportunities for school districts to expand GI in schoolyards, leveraging their potential to increase ecosystem services to all children, from increased educational opportunities to improved mental, physical, and environmental well-being. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH",2022,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,67,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127434,#3324,Zhang 2022,"Zhang et al., 2022",Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,
Examining the distributional equity of urban tree canopy cover and ecosystem services across United States cities,"Riley, C.B.; Gardiner, M.M.","Examining the distributional equity of urban tree canopy cover (UTCC) has increasingly become an important interdisciplinary focus of ecologists and social scientists working within the field of environmental justice. However, while UTCC may serve as a useful proxy for the benefits provided by the urban forest, it is ultimately not a direct measure. In this study, we quantified the monetary value of multiple ecosystem services (ESD) provisioned by urban forests across nine U.S. cities. Next, we examined the distributional equity of UTCC and ESD using a number of commonly investigated socioeconomic variables. Based on trends in the literature, we predicted that UTCC and ESD would be positively associated with the variables median income and percent with an undergraduate degree and negatively associated with the variables percent minority, percent poverty, percent without a high school degree, percent renters, median year home built, and population density. We also predicted that there would be differences in the relationships between each response variable (UTCC and ESD) and the suite of socioeconomic predictor variables examined because of differences in how each response variable is derived. We utilized methods promoted within the environmental justice literature, including a multi-city comparative analysis, the incorporation of high-resolution social and environmental datasets, and the use of spatially explicit models. Patterns between the socioeconomic variables and UTCC and ESD did not consistently support our predictions, highlighting that inequities are generally not universal but rather context dependent. Our results also illustrated that although the variables UTCC and ESD had largely similar relationships with the predictor variables, differences did occur between them. Future distributional equity research should move beyond the use of proxies for environmental amenities when possible while making sure to consider that the use of ecosystem service estimates may result in different patterns with socioeconomic variables of interest. Based on our findings, we conclude that understanding and remedying the challenges associated with inequities requires an understanding of the local social-ecological system if larger sustainability goals are to be achieved. © 2020 Riley, Gardiner.

"Luxury and legacy effects on urban biodiversity, vegetation cover and ecosystem services","Aznarez, C; Svenning, JC; Pacheco, JP; Kallesoe, FH; Baro, F; Pascual, U","Socio-economic and historical drivers shape urban nature distribution and characteristics, as luxury (wealth-related) and legacy (historical management) effects. Using remote sensing and census data on biodiversity and socio-economic indicators, we examined these effects on urban biodiversity and vegetation cover in Vitoria-Gasteiz (Basque Country). We also tested the luxury and legacy hypotheses on regulating ecosystem services (ES) and explored predictor interactions. Higher educational attainment positively correlated with urban biodiversity, confirming the luxury effect, but had no effect on vegetation cover or ES. Older areas had higher vegetation cover and ES evidencing a legacy effect with an inverse response on biodiversity, attributable to more recent management strategies promoting biodiversity in green spaces. Habitat quality amplified the luxury effect, while population density strengthened the legacy effect. Our results suggest that urban biodiversity is mainly driven by socio-economic factors, while vegetation cover and ES are influenced by management legacies in interaction with population density.",2023,NPJ URBAN SUSTAINABILITY,3,1,,10.1038/s42949-023-00128-7,#7488,Aznarez 2023,"Aznarez et al., 2023",No,,,,,,,,,,,
Access to green and gray urban nature amenities: exploring equity in Montreal's built environment,"Chavez, J.A.J.; Boisjoly, G.; Manaugh, K.","Contemporary ideologies have identified two main paradigms contributing to sustainable cities: green urban and gray urban nature. The first refers to features that make cities greener, such as parks or tree coverage. The second refers to gray but sustainable areas, such as dense areas or the proximity to key amenities that can foster active travel. Accessibility to green and gray urban nature amenities by active transport is essential for evaluating if cities are sustainable. We analyzed the accessibility to green (green spaces) and gray (food stores and pharmacies) urban nature in Montreal. The findings show that most people have sufficient access to green and gray urban nature, and low-income groups have better access than high-income groups. Areas with access to both tend to be highly dense, suggesting that dense areas have sustainable attributes.

Using anonymized mobility data to reduce inequality in the availability and use of urban parks,"Filazzola, A.; Xie, G.; Birchard, K.; Shrestha, N.; Brown, D.; MacIvor, J.S.","Parks are an integral component of cities. Ensuring city residents have equitable and easy access to parks is crucial for human well-being. In temperate climates, park accessibility is particularly important in the summer months when these green spaces provide an area to recreate, exercise and escape indoor temperatures and heat emanating from paved and built surfaces. However, there are well-known disparities in park accessibility in cities globally that may threaten the health of city residents, especially with global warming. We examined some of the largest city parks (>50 ha) in Toronto, Canada, by comparing park activity, housing demographics and daily weather patterns. We found that parks that provided more green space area per resident were situated in neighbourhoods that had higher proportions of single-detached housing, higher automobile use and fewer multistorey apartments. We also found a strong correlation between park activity with population density and the number of amenities in the park. Surprisingly, we found no relationship between park activity and daily weather patterns, although park use was higher on weekends and holidays. These results suggest denser communities are at a disadvantage because they have proportionately less park area within walking distance in addition to having no private green spaces (e.g. backyards). We recommend revising municipal zoning around certain parks and the creation of new green spaces as methods to balance park provisioning in the city. Our findings suggest that designing and maintaining accessible, amenity-rich parks is an important strategy for promoting health and well-being in urban populations.

Canopy of advantage: Who benefits most from city trees?,"Greene, C.S.; Robinson, P.J.; Millward, A.A.","Urban tree canopy provides a suite of ecological, social, and economic benefits to the residents of urban areas. With an expanding recognition of these benefits among city residents, there is growing concern that access to these benefits is not distributed equally and may represent the presence of an environmental injustice. This study examines the spatial relationship between median household income and tree canopy variables, specifically realized tree canopy cover and potential tree canopy cover, for Toronto, Canada. Toronto provides a strong empirical focus as it is a densely populated urban setting reported to be exhibiting an increase in the geographic polarization of residents based upon household income. Spatial relationships between median household income and tree canopy variables are evaluated using the bivariate Moran's I statistic, a specialized local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA). This method explicitly identified where statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low household income coincide with significant clusters of high and low urban tree canopy, providing the basis for an examination of the policies and management decisions that led to this temporal snapshot. The importance of these spatial clusters is examined from the perspective of understanding the impact of urban change (both socio-demographic and built form), and from the standpoint of improving equality of access to city trees and their benefits resulting from future tree planting decisions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018,Journal of Environmental Management,208,,24-35,10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.12.015,#4581,Greene 2018,"Greene et al., 2018",No,,,,,,,,,,,
"Environmental Injustice, Tree Canopy Cover, and Academic Proficiency at Utah Public Primary Schools","Grineski, S.E.; Griego, A.; Mullen, C.; Collins, T.; Nadybal, S.; Mangadu, A.","Background: Tree canopy cover has mental and physical health benefits for children, yet distributional environmental injustices in tree canopy cover near schools are rarely investigated. Some evidence suggests that tree canopy coverage positively influences aggregated school-level children's academic proficiency metrics. There is a lack of research if canopy cover moderates the negative effect of particulate matter on academic proficiency. Methods: We linked data on schools from the National Center for Education Statistics, Utah's Student Assessment of Growth and Excellence, the National Land Cover Database, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We used generalized estimating equations, which account for non-normally distributed data and clustering, to analyze data from the 2015 to 2016 school year. Results: Greater school social disadvantage (higher percentages of students qualifying for free/reduced price meals and higher percentages of racial/ethnic minority students) was significantly associated with reductions in tree canopy cover within 1000 m and 500 m of the school. Greater tree canopy coverage at 1000 m and 500 m was significantly associated with a lower percentage of students testing below proficient on year-end math and language arts exams. Additional days of peak fine particulate matter were associated with higher percentages of students testing below proficient in math. Discussion: Socially disadvantaged primary schools in Utah were surrounded by less canopy cover. There was a protective effect of tree canopy cover on academic proficiency in math and language arts. Conclusion: Findings suggest targeting carefully designed tree planting efforts at socially disadvantaged schools and testing interventions involving tree planting and changes in academic proficiency. © 2024 Mary Ann Liebert Inc..

"Ecosystem services and urban heat riskscape moderation: Water, green spaces, and social inequality in Phoenix, USA","Jenerette, G.D.; Harlan, S.L.; Stefanov, W.L.; Martin, C.A.","Urban ecosystems are subjected to high temperatures-extreme heat events, chronically hot weather, or both-through interactions between local and global climate processes. Urban vegetation may provide a cooling ecosystem service, although many knowledge gaps exist in the biophysical and social dynamics of using this service to reduce climate extremes. To better understand patterns of urban vegetated cooling, the potential water requirements to supply these services, and differential access to these services between residential neighborhoods, we evaluated three decades (1970-2000) of land surface characteristics and residential segregation by income in the Phoenix, Arizona, USA metropolitan region. We developed an ecosystem service trade-offs approach to assess the urban heat riskscape, defined as the spatial variation in risk exposure and potential human vulnerability to extreme heat. In this region, vegetation provided nearly a 25°C surface cooling compared to bare soil on low-humidity summer days; the magnitude of this service was strongly coupled to air temperature and vapor pressure deficits. To estimate the water loss associated with land-surface cooling, we applied a surface energy balance model. Our initial estimates suggest 2.7 mm/d of water may be used in supplying cooling ecosystem services in the Phoenix region on a summer day. The availability and corresponding resource use requirements of these ecosystem services had a strongly positive relationship with neighborhood income in the year 2000. However, economic stratification in access to services is a recent development: no vegetation-income relationship was observed in 1970, and a clear trend of increasing correlation was evident through 2000. To alleviate neighborhood inequality in risks from extreme heat through increased vegetation and evaporative cooling, large increases in regional water use would be required. Together, these results suggest the need for a systems evaluation of the benefits, costs, spatial structure, and temporal trajectory for the use of ecosystem services to moderate climate extremes. Increasing vegetation is one strategy for moderating regional climate changes in urban areas and simultaneously providing multiple ecosystem services. However, vegetation has economic, water, and social equity implications that vary dramatically across neighborhoods and need to be managed through informed environmental policies. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",2011,Ecological Applications,21,7,2637-2651,10.1890/10-1493.1,#5399,Jenerette 2011,"Jenerette et al., 2011",No,,,,,,,,,,,
Convergence of urban forest and socio-economic indicators of resilience: A study of environmental inequality in four major cities in eastern Canada,"Landry, F; Dupras, J; Messier, C","Environmental inequality is a phenomenon drawing much attention in the scientific and policy-making debates about urban forests and city greening. Most studies on the subject have shown that socially vulnerable, multicultural neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by the lack of urban forest while richer neighborhoods tend to be greener. But are there differences in the resilience of urban forests between poor and rich neighborhoods? We tackled this question using a newly developed indicator of urban forest resilience, functional diversity, to determine if environmental injustice is also found in the resilience of urban forests in poor neighborhoods. Using Canadian census data at the census tract scale, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and urban tree inventories, this study investigated if urban forest resilience is also part of the environmental inequality phenomenon in four urban areas in eastern Canada: Toronto, Gatineau-Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec City. Multivariate analysis of the dataset shows that urban forest functional diversity, used as an indicator of resilience, is inversely correlated to a set of variables associated with social vulnerability. The same relationship also exists with canopy cover; a pattern of inequality found in many cities around the world. With these findings, we show that social vulnerability and urban forest resilience are intertwined, meaning that neighborhoods already lacking urban forest are also more at risk of losing it due to a sudden environmental disturbance. When confronted with global change, considering this new insight into urban environmental inequality could be of great importance for maintaining a comfortable living environment for every city-dweller.",2020,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,202,,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103856,#6510,Landry 2020,"Landry et al., 2020",No,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do infrastructure deserts exist? Measuring and mapping infrastructure equity: A case study in Dallas, Texas, USA","Li, Z; Wang, XL; Zarazaga, J; Smith-Colin, J; Minsker, B","Neighborhood infrastructure, such as sidewalks, medical facilities, public transit, community gathering places, and tree canopy, provides essential support for safe, healthy, and resilient communities. This paper examines the presence and condition of neighborhood infrastructure and shows that ""infrastructure deserts "" exist, which are low-income neighborhoods with significantly more deficient infrastructure. A generalized data-driven frame-work is developed and implemented at the street-level for 12 types of neighborhood infrastructure in Dallas, Texas. The results show significant infrastructure inequities across income levels for most types of infrastructure. Statistical inference predicts (with 95 % confidence) that low-income neighborhoods are 2.0 to 3.5 times more likely to have highly deficient infrastructure (8 or more deficient infrastructure types) than high-income areas and 1.4 to 2.4 times more likely to have highly deficient infrastructure than middle-income neighborhoods.

Vulnerable groups in severe heat: A study assessing the impacts of climate and Pocket Park visitations pre-post the pandemic,"Liu, P.; Guo, Z.; Song, Y.; Fernandez, J.","Urbanization and climate change are intensifying disparities in access to green spaces, particularly for vulnerable populations such as low-income groups and older adults in areas with sever heat. COVID-19 and its aftereffects exacerbate this inequity of urban land use, especially for these populations. While previous studies explored park uses and the effects of climate, limited study have investigated how small scale urban park visitation patterns are shaped by the combined influence of park features and climate conditions using large scale smart phone mobility data, especially across different phases of a disruptive event like a pandemic. This study examines how pocket parks—small, neighborhood-based green spaces—serve as critical resources for these groups in high-density urban areas, focusing on Austin, Texas, as a case study. By analyzing visitation patterns before and during the pandemic using geospatial data and novel smartphone mobility data retrieved from Advan from 2018 to 2021, the research reveals an increasing trend of low-income groups and older adults relying heavily on pocket parks due to limited access to larger green spaces and private outdoor areas during the pandemic. Older adults and low-income groups were more sensitive to precipitation, wind, and maximin temperature during the pandemic as these factors closely associated with virus transmission. Park features that contribute to micro-climate regulation and health promotion reported higher significance to these visitors than areas designed for group activities since such features can decrease the effects of extreme heat and the risks of infection. These results underscore the need for equitable urban land use policies that prioritize the development and maintenance of pocket parks in underserved communities, especially under severe urban climate. By addressing both social and environmental vulnerabilities, this study contributes actionable insights for urban planners and policymakers striving to create inclusive and resilient cities with consideration of public health. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",2025,Urban Climate,61,,,10.1016/j.uclim.2025.102444,#703,Liu 2025,"Liu et al., 2025",No,,,,,,,,,,,
Disparities in urban neighborhood conditions: evidence from GIS measures and field observation in New York City.,"Neckerman, KM; Lovasi GS; Davies S; Purciel M; Quinn J; Feder E; Raghunath N; Wasserman B; Rundle A","Although many low-income urban areas are highly walkable by conventional measures such as population density or land use mix, chronic diseases related to lack of physical activity are more common among residents of these areas. Disparities in neighborhood conditions may make poor areas less attractive environments for walking, offsetting the advantages of density and land use mix. This study compared poor and nonpoor neighborhoods in New York City, using geographic information systems measures constructed from public data for US census tracts within New York City (N=2,172) as well as field observation of a matched-pair sample of 76 block faces on commercial streets in poor and nonpoor neighborhoods. Poor census tracts had significantly fewer street trees, landmarked buildings, clean streets, and sidewalk cafes, and higher rates of felony complaints, narcotics arrests, and vehicular crashes.

"Inequality and allergenic cover of urban greenspaces surrounding public elementary schools in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","Ng, A.; Gergel, S.E.; Eskelson, B.N.I.","Inequality in the spatial distribution of urban greenspaces occurs globally, with greater greenspaces in neighbourhoods with higher socioeconomic status. This is problematic, as greenspaces provide numerous ecosystem services, including benefits to human health. However, greenspaces can also trigger allergenic responses, inducing negative economic, medical, and social costs. Using geospatial information, we investigated 91 elementary schools in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to answer: (1) Does the amount and type of greenspaces and greyspaces surrounding schools vary with median household income? and (2) Does the surface area of allergenic greenspace surrounding schools vary with median household income? We characterized landcover within a 300 m radius of public elementary schools using a high spatial resolution urban landcover map of Vancouver derived from a combination of RapidEye imagery from 2014 and airborne laser scanning. Beta regression and analysis of variance models were used to explore associations between household incomes and greenspaces, as well as allergenic vegetation near schools. Schools in areas with higher median annual household incomes (>$80,000 CAD) were surrounded by an average of 14% more greenspaces and 16% less greyspaces than schools located in areas with lower household incomes (<$50,000 CAD). Schools in higher income areas were also surrounded by an average of 81% more cover of allergenic vegetation than schools in lower income areas. Greenspaces are a valuable source of ecosystem services for urban residents and should be distributed equally to optimize their benefits; however, they must be planned carefully to avoid the introduction of disservices from allergenic vegetation. © 2021 The Author(s).

Equal Opportunity Streets: Assessing the Equity of Publicly Provisioned Street Trees in Walk Zones Surrounding Elementary Schools,"Paddle, E.; Gilliland, J.","Given the previously established, social, economic, and healthful benefits of nearby nature in local environments, we argue that the provision of publicly funded street trees as a positive urban environmental exposure should be considered as an ""environmental justice"" issue. Accordingly, the study examines the distribution of street trees within a 10-minute walking radius around elementary schools in four communities of different sizes in Ontario, Canada, to assess potential levels of ""exposure"" to these positive natural features among school-age children of different sociodemographic backgrounds. A geographic information system incorporating detailed geodatabases of pubic trees and elementary schools in Stratford, Woodstock, Brantford, and London was used to analyze the spatial distribution of trees in relation to the socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhood walking zones around every elementary school. Our findings indicate that the spatial distribution of street trees in the immediate vicinity around the schools in the four southwestern Ontario cities studied closely mirrors the pattern of socioeconomic distress in those same cites. The findings point to a greater need for municipal planners, policymakers, and community-based organizations to carefully consider the socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods to ensure that future tree planting efforts are conducted in an equitable manner and targeted to the areas with the greatest need for the associated benefits they provide. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2018,Environmental Justice,11,4,154-164,10.1089/env.2017.0002,#4507,Paddle 2018,"Paddle & Gilliland, 2018",No,,,,,,,,,,,
"Predictors of the distribution of street and backyard vegetation in Montreal, Canada.","Pham, T.-T.-H.; Apparicio, P.; Landry, S.M.; Sa©guin, A.-M.; Gagnon, M.","Urban vegetation is shown to be unevenly distributed across cities and there is evidence of disparities in benefits provided by vegetation and of public health problems induced by urban heat islands. In order to improve vegetation cover, it remains crucial to understand the underpinning of such unevenness. In this paper, we investigate in Montreal (Canada) how the built environment, sociodemographic factors and administrative boroughs influence tree and lawn cover in public and residential land. The analysis was conducted at the dissemination area (DA) level, a Canadian census unit containing about 400-700 people. Six vegetation indicators were used as dependent variables: the proportion of a DA covered by trees/shrubs, lawn and total vegetation; the proportion of streets covered by trees/shrubs and the proportion of residential yards covered by trees/shrubs and total vegetation. Three sets of independent variables were studied: the built environment, sociodemographics and borough names. We used spatial autoregressive models to control for dependence and the spatial autoregressive term explained a large amount of variability in vegetation cover. The built-environment variables tend to have higher effects than the socio-demographic variables when predicting the three DA vegetation indicators, backyard vegetation, and to a lesser degree, street tree/shrub cover. In particular, population density is associated negatively to all indicators but positively to street tree cover. Socio-demographics are substantial in the explanation of the distribution of street trees, especially the presence of recent immigrants (negative effect) and of university degree holders (positive effect). These findings call for appropriate greening programs adapted to the local socio-demographic profile. The significance of boroughs also suggests the need for further research on the impact of within-city administrative hierarchies on the unevenness of urban vegetation. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",2013,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,12,1,18-27,10.1016/j.ufug.2012.09.002,#5283,Pham 2013,"Pham et al., 2013",No,,,,,,,,,,,
"Access to Parks and Green Spaces in Quebec City, Canada: Developing Children-Specific Accessibility Measures","Robillard, A.; Boisjoly, G.; Waygood, E.O.D.","Accessibility indicators are gaining traction in research and planning as they provide a joint understanding of how transport networks and land-use patterns enable individuals to reach a variety of destinations. Local accessibility is especially beneficial for children as they do not have the same capacities to travel as adults and their independent mobility is generally constrained to active modes such as walking and cycling. Further, active and independent travel are linked to their health and well-being. Yet, there does not appear to have been much work done in relation to developing accessibility indicators specific to children. This study presents a methodology to specifically assess accessibility to parks (a key destination for children) on foot and by bicycle for children in Quebec City, Canada using open-access data. Accessibility indicators were generated for each residential lot based on the suitability of the pedestrian and cycling infrastructure for children. The number of parks accessible was presented and the equity of accessibility to parks was considered through population and socioeconomic measures. The results revealed a notable decrease in walking accessibility when only dedicated pedestrian infrastructure was considered, and differences between walking and cycling accessibility. This enabled the identification of accessibility gaps where the existing infrastructure did not provide safe access to parks and green spaces for children This research will be of interest to researchers and planners aiming to refine accessibility indicators to support children’s independent mobility, while taking equity into consideration. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2023.",2023,Transportation Research Record,2677,10,464-477,10.1177/03611981231161618,#2293,Robillard 2023,"Robillard et al., 2023",No,,,,,,,,,,,
The Spatial Logic of Parks,"Talen, E","Urban parks are usually studied as discrete, green public open spaces. Less studied is how parks are geographically distributed from a 'spatial logic' point of view, i.e. how they ought to be geographically distributed across the urban landscape. This paper evaluates the degree to which normative principles about park distribution are in evidence from the standpoint of three spatial goals: proximity, diversity and social need. Using Phoenix and Chicago as case studies, it offers an empirical example of how park distribution can be shown to conform (or not) to one or more distributive patterns. Descriptive measures show that Phoenix parks do not conform to any of these three distributional principles, while Chicago parks do somewhat better. In both cities, land uses surrounding parks heavily favour residential uses. In Phoenix, single-family homes are prioritized, making spatial distribution based on proximity, diversity or social need difficult. A strategy for acquiring a better spatial logic, within existing realities and constraints, is suggested.",2010,JOURNAL OF URBAN DESIGN,15,4,473-491,10.1080/13574809.2010.502335,#7215,Talen 2010,"Talen, 2010",No,,,,,,,,,,,
"Urban green inequality and its mismatches with human demand across neighborhoods in New York, Amsterdam, and Beijing","Tian, Y.; Van Leeuwen, E.; Tsendbazar, N.-E.; Jing, C.; Herold, M.","Context: Urban green spaces (UGS) are not evenly distributed within cities, and some neighborhoods with high socio-environmental demands require more UGS than others. This raises two challenges: green inequality and demand-based inequity. However, comprehensive assessments of UGS inequality and inequity in cities worldwide are lacking. Objectives: We aim to develop a multi-level approach and supply-demand concept to assess UGS inequality and inequity across neighborhoods in international cities with contrasting geographical and socio-political contexts. Methods: We measured multi-level green accessibility and human demands based on Earth Observation and statistical data. UGS inequality and supply-demand mismatches were assessed by Gini coefficients, spatial cluster analysis, and statistical models. Results: We found that: (1) UGS inequality is primarily reflected by the public park per capita in three cities. New York has larger UGS inequality than Beijing and Amsterdam. (2) Demand-based inequity in terms of low supply and high demand is mainly scattered around the city center in three cities. Tree coverage does not align with environmental pressures (LST/PM2.5) in New York and Beijing. (3) Relations between green supplies and human demands vary by cities and indicators. A shorter distance to the nearest large park is associated with a higher proportion of the elderly and children in New York and Amsterdam. Conclusions: Our findings can inform UGS allocations to improve landscape sustainability in the neighborhoods with low green supply and high human demand, and to prioritize specific green metrics based on demand-oriented equity. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,Landscape Ecology,39,3,,10.1007/s10980-024-01874-4,#1877,Tian 2024,"Tian et al., 2024",No,,,,,,,,,,,
A geographical approach to identifying vegetation-related environmental equity in Canadian cities,"Tooke, T.R.; Klinkenberg, B.; Coops, N.C.","The research in this paper addresses human-environment interactions in Canadian cities by examining the spatial distribution of vegetation in relation to various socioeconomic indicators. Specifically, intercity and intracity comparisons are evaluated using correlation analysis and geo- graphically weighted regression (GWR). Vegetation abundance estimates derived from spectral mixture analysis of Landsat imagery are compared with Canadian census data for the cities of Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver to quantify vegetation-related environmental equity in Canada's largest urban centres. Results exhibit strong and consistent correlations between median family income and vegetation fraction for Montreal (r. 0:473), Toronto (r. 0:467), and Vancouver (r. 0:456). Furthermore, examining the GWR results suggests that employing an adaptive bandwidth kernel technique with a manual selection of ten neighbours for each observation provides a greater range and higher median values for local regression estimates (Montreal: 0.69; Toronto: 0.74; Vancouver: 0.73) as compared with the Akaike information criterion-selection method. Finally, we discuss the potential application of the presented analysis techniques for urban planning and community-development initiatives, specifically associated with managing vegetation-related environmental equity at various scales. Possible applications of these techniques for urban planning purposes are discussed, and key methodological considerations for performing such an analysis are highlighted. © 2010 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.",2010,Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design,37,6,1040-1056,10.1068/b36044,#5515,Tooke 2010,"Tooke et al., 2010",No,,,,,,,,,,,
Socio-Spatial Disparities in Urban Green Space Resilience to Flooding: A 20-Year Analysis Across the Southeastern U.S,"Zhao, K.; Meng, X.","While urban green spaces are integral to urban resilience, their long-term dynamics under recurrent flooding have received limited scholarly attention. This study investigates two decades of green space change across 367 counties in the southeastern United States, integrating FEMA disaster records with multi-period land cover data. Employing generalized additive and logistic regression models, the impacts of flood frequency, development intensity, and socioeconomic drivers were assessed. Flood frequency was identified as the primary determinant of urban green space loss. Each additional flood event corresponded to a 0.36% reduction in the five-year green space change rate (p < 0.01), while extreme flood frequency (≥ 10 events) was associated with an 18-fold increase in the odds of long-term degradation. Development intensity exhibited a significant non-linear effect, with loss rates culminating at moderate-to-high intensities. Furthermore, household income functioned as a significant moderator; in extremely flood-prone areas, higher income correlated with enhanced resilience (OR = 0.155, p < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that recurrent floods function as a cumulative pressure. This research highlights the necessity of equitable green infrastructure planning that integrates flood risk with the complex, moderating role of socioeconomic capacity. © 2025 by the authors.",2025,Buildings,15,21,,10.3390/buildings15213866,#279,Zhao 2025,"Zhao & Meng, 2025",No,,,,,,,,,,,
Income and Racial Disparities in Access to Public Parks and Private Recreation Facilities,"Abercrombie, L.C.; Sallis, J.F.; Conway, T.L.; Frank, L.D.; Saelens, B.E.; Chapman, J.E.","Background: Disparities in health outcomes and health behaviors may be partially explained by neighborhood environments that are poor in resources that could support healthy behaviors. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that low-income and high-minority neighborhoods have less access to public parks, open space, and private recreation facilities. Methods: From 2004 to 2005, an inventory of 351 private recreation facilities and 465 public parks was conducted in 833 Census block groups in Maryland. In 2-way ANCOVAs, numbers of private facilities and public parks, as well as maximum park size, were studied in relation to categories of median income and percent non-white population in the block groups. Results: For the number of private recreation facilities, there was no significant effect of income or percent minority. For number and size of parks, the interaction between income and percent minority was significant. Mixed-race neighborhoods had the highest number of parks, regardless of income. Low- and middle-income groups living in mostly-white block groups and high-income groups living in mostly-minority block groups had the lowest access to public parks. Conclusions: The expected deprivation of recreation facilities in low-income and high-minority neighborhoods was not found. There are exceptions to the inequalities found nationally, so the policies or practices associated with a fairer distribution of recreation resources in some local areas need to be better understood. © 2008 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",2008,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,34,1,15-Sep,10.1016/j.amepre.2007.09.030,#5615,Abercrombie 2008,"Abercrombie et al., 2008",,,,,,,,,,,,
Playground safety and quality in chicago,"Allen, E.M.; Hill, A.L.; Tranter, E.; Sheehan, K.M.","OBJECTIVES: To assess playground safety and quality in Chicago, Illinois, identify disparities in access, and use the data to inform collaborative improvement. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of public park playgrounds in Chicago, Illinois, was conducted in 2009, 2010, and 2011 by using the National Program for Playground Safety Standardized Survey. All playgrounds were surveyed in 2009 and 2010; those that failed in 2010 were resurveyed in 2011. Playgrounds were assessed in 4 main categories: age-appropriate design, fall surfacing, equipment maintenance, and physical environment. Safety scores were generated from the assessment. Geographic information system mapping provided a visual description of the playground pass/fail rate based on neighborhood, child population, race/ethnicity, and poverty level. RESULTS: Of the ~500 playgrounds, 467 were assessed in 2009, and 459 were assessed in 2010. In 2009, half of all playgrounds (55%) and in 2010, nearly two-thirds (61%) earned scores consistent with safe playgrounds (P , .001). Playgrounds scored poorest in fall surfacing and equipment maintenance. Geographic information system mapping showed neighborhoods with a higher percentage of children and impoverished families had fewer playgrounds and more failing playgrounds. In 2011, 154 (85%) of the playgrounds that failed in 2010 were surveyed. The mean playground score among failing playgrounds improved significantly between 2010 (61%) and 2011 (67%, P , .001). CONCLUSIONS: Since the playground improvement initiative began in 2009, considerable progress has been made in the safety scores, although access to high-quality playgrounds varies by neighborhood. Many failing playgrounds can be brought up to standard with improvement in fall surfacing and equipment maintenance.

Communities recognize the value of trees in mitigating these challenges by absorbing pollution and enhancing walkability. However, siting trees to optimize multiple benefits requires a systems approach that may cross sectors of management and expertise. We present a spatially-explicit method to optimize tree planting in Durham, NC, a rapidly growing urban areawith an aging tree stock. Using GIS data and a ranking approach, we explored where Durham could augment its current stock of willow oaks through its plans to install 10,000mid-sized deciduous trees. Data included high-resolution landcover metrics developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), demographics from the U.S. Census, an attributed roads dataset licensed to the EPA, and sidewalk information from the City of Durham. Census block groups (CBGs) were ranked for tree planting according to single and multiple objectives including stormwater reduction, emissions buffering, walkability, and protection of vulnerable populations. Prioritizing tree planting based on single objectives led to four sets of locations with limited geographic overlap. Prioritizing tree planting based on multiple objectives tended to favor historically disadvantaged CBGs. The four-objective strategy met the largest proportion of estimated regional need. Based on this analysis, the City of Durham has implemented a seven-year plan to plant 10,000 trees in priority neighborhoods. This analysis also found that any strategy which included the protection of vulnerable populations generated more benefits than others. © 2018 by the authors.",2018,Sustainability (Switzerland),10,12,,10.3390/su10124488,#4462,Almeter 2018,"Almeter et al., 2018",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just street trees? Street trees increase local biodiversity and biomass in higher income, denser neighborhoods","Anderson, E.C.; Locke, D.H.; Pickett, S.T.A.; LaDeau, S.L.","Tree canopy cover is a critical component of the urban environment that supports ecosystem services at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Increasing tree canopy across a matrix of public and private land is challenging. As such, municipalities often plant trees along streets in public rights-of-way where there are fewer barriers to establishment, and composition and biomass of street trees are inextricably linked to human decisions, management, and care. In this study, we investigated the contributions of street trees to the broader urban forest, inclusive of tree canopy distributed across both public and private parcels in Baltimore, MD, USA. We assess how species composition, biodiversity, and biomass of street trees specifically augment the urban forest at local and citywide scales. Furthermore, we evaluate how street tree contributions to the urban forest vary with social and demographic characteristics of local residential communities. Our analyses demonstrate that street trees significantly enhanced citywide metrics of the urban forests' richness and tree biomass, adding an average six unique species per site. However, street tree contributions did not ameliorate low tree canopy locations, and more street tree biomass was generally aligned with higher urban forest cover. Furthermore, species richness, abundance, and biomass added by street trees were all positively related to local household income and population density. Our results corroborate previous findings that wealthier urban neighborhoods often have greater tree abundance and canopy cover and, additionally, suggest that investment in municipally managed street trees may be reinforcing inequities in distribution and function of the urban forest. This suggests a need for greater attention to where and why street tree plantings occur, what species are selected, and how planted tree survival is maintained by and for residents in different neighborhoods. © 2023 The Authors.

In response to limited quantitative evidence documenting the temporal relationship between new greenspaces and gentrification across entire cities, let alone across various international contexts, we employ a spatially weighted Bayesian model to test the green gentrification hypothesis across 28 cities in 9 countries in North America and Europe.

Yet, little is known about the extent to which this incentive has generated a spatial relationship between green space and newly constructed housing at the city-wide level and in ways that can be compared between cities. This gap in knowledge makes it difficult to precisely indicate the implications for housing rights, affordability, and broader goals of urban green justice. In response, this study explores quantitative trends in 26 mid-sized North American and European cities, utilizing greening and real estate data from the last three decades. Results show that greening becomes a more significant driver of development over time and operates to attract development in a growing number of cities, although more so in US cities. Next, in order to contextualize the quantitative results, we employ qualitative field data gathered through field work in Atlanta and Amsterdam. We contrast the greening and development trajectories of these cities by examining implications for housing rights and social justice, accounting for the fact that those cities exhibit different green gentrification trends, as demonstrated in the literature. Green gentrification is indeed a proxy for understanding housing justice implications in the relationship between greening and development. We find that Amsterdam's legacy of housing rights and policies acts as a protection against growing inequities embedded in the relationship between urban greening, development, and gentrification. In contrast, Atlanta embodies patterns of historic racial segregation and continued gentrification of Black neighborhoods which urban greening has further intensified. This analysis shows that greening can attract real estate development across a city, but the implications need not always be harmful to social equity. © 2024 The Authors",2024,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,101,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128376,#1488,Anguelovski 2024,"Anguelovski et al., 2024",,,,,,,,,,,,
Spatial distribution of vegetation in and around city blocks on the Island of Montreal: A double environmental inequity?,"Apparicio, P.; Pham, T.-T.-H.; Sa©guin, A.-M.; Duba, J.","Recent studies have shown that urban vegetation is unevenly distributed across numerous North American cities: neighbourhoods predominantly inhabited by low-income populations and/or by certain ethnic groups have less vegetation cover. The goal of this paper is to examine the existence of environmental inequities related to access to urban vegetation on the Island of Montreal for four population groups (low-income people, visible minorities, individuals 0–14 years old and persons 65 years old and over). Six indicators of vegetation in and around residential city blocks (within 250 m and 500 m) are computed by using QuickBird satellite images. These indicators are then related to socioeconomic data by using different statistical analyses (T-test, seemingly unrelated regression and multinomial logistic regression). The results show that low-income people and, to a lesser degree, visible minorities reside in areas where vegetation is less abundant. On the other hand, the opposite situation is found for children and the elderly. The use of indicators computed in and around city blocks leads to the finding of a double inequity in certain neighbourhoods. This points to the need to target vegetation-deprived areas for urgent greening in order to improve vegetation cover within city blocks (in residential yards or through alternatives such as green walls and green roofs) and around these blocks (along streets and in parks). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2016,Applied Geography,76,,128-136,10.1016/j.apgeog.2016.09.023,#4830,Apparicio 2016,"Apparicio et al., 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spatial analysis of landscape and sociodemographic factors associated with green stormwater infrastructure distribution in Baltimore, Maryland and Portland, Oregon","Baker, A.; Brenneman, E.; Chang, H.; McPhillips, L.; Matsler, M.","This study explores the spatial distribution of green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) relative to sociodemographic and landscape characteristics in Portland, OR, and Baltimore, MD, USA at census block group (CBG) and census tract scales. GSI density is clustered in Portland, while it is randomly distributed over space in Baltimore. Variables that exhibit relationships with GSI density are varied over space, as well as between cities. In Baltimore, GSI density is significantly associated with presence of green space (+), impervious surface coverage (+), and population density (−) at the CBG scale; though these relationships vary over space. At the census tract scale in Baltimore, a different combination of indicators explains GSI density, including elevation (+), population characteristics, and building characteristics. Spatial regression analysis in Portland indicates that GSI density at the CBG scale is associated with residents identifying as White (−) and well-draining hydrologic soil groups A and B (−). At both census tract and CBG scales, GSI density is associated with median income (−) and sewer pipe density (−). Hierarchical modelling of GSI density presents significant spatial dependence as well as group dependence implicit to Portland at the census tract scale.

Widespread Race and Class Disparities in Surface Urban Heat Extremes Across the United States,"Benz, S.A.; Burney, J.A.","Here we use remotely sensed land surface temperature measurements to explore the distribution of the United States’ urban heating burden, both at high resolution (within cities or counties) and at scale (across the whole contiguous United States). While a rich literature has documented neighborhood-level disparities in urban heat exposures in individual cities, data constraints have precluded comparisons across locations. Here, drawing on urban temperature anomalies during extreme summer surface temperature events from all 1,056 US counties with more than 10 developed census tracts, we find that the poorest tracts (and those with lowest average education levels) within a county are significantly hotter than the richest (and more educated) neighborhoods for 76% of these counties (54% for education); we also find that neighborhoods with higher Black, Hispanic, and Asian population shares are hotter than the more White, non-Hispanic areas in each county. This holds in counties with both large and small spreads in these population shares, and for 71% of all counties the significant racial urban heat disparities persist even when adjusting for income. Although individual locations have different histories that have contributed to race- and class-based geographies, we find that the physical features of the urban environments driving these surface heat exposure gradients are fairly uniform across the country. Systematically, the disproportionate heat surface exposures faced by minority communities are due to more built-up neighborhoods, less vegetation, and—to a lesser extent—higher population density. © 2021.

"Urban Morphology Drives the Homogenization of Tree Cover in Baltimore, MD, and Raleigh, NC","Bigsby, KM; McHale, MR; Hess, GR","Heterogeneous land cover patterns contribute to unique ecological conditions in cities and little is known about the drivers of these patterns among cities. We studied tree cover patterns in relationship to urban morphology (for example, housing density, parcel size), socioeconomic factors (for example, education, income, lifestyle characteristics), and historical legacies in Baltimore, Maryland, and Raleigh, North Carolina. Utilizing a multimodel inference approach and bivariate analyses, we analyzed two primary datasets employed in previous research predicting urban tree cover-one comprising continuous data (US Census), and the other consisting of categorical variables (Claritas PRIZM) that incorporate consumer purchasing data. Continuous data revealed that urban morphological characteristics were better predictors of tree cover patterns than socioeconomic factors in Raleigh and Baltimore at the parcel and neighborhood scales. Although the categorical dataset provided some evidence for the importance of socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics in predicting tree cover patterns, the hierarchical nature of these data preclude separating the impacts of these factors from levels of urbanization. Bivariate analyses of continuous and categorical variables revealed that the highest correlation coefficients were associated with variables describing urban morphology-parcel size, percent pervious area, and house age. In Baltimore, historical census data were better predictors of present-day tree cover than census data from recent years. Most notably, parcel size, a key predictor of tree cover, has decreased with time in Raleigh to sizes consistently seen in Baltimore. Our findings demonstrate that urban morphology, the main driver of tree cover patterns in these cities, may lead to the homogenization of tree canopy in Raleigh and Baltimore in the future.",2014,ECOSYSTEMS,17,2,212-227,10.1007/s10021-013-9718-4,#7615,Bigsby 2014,"Bigsby et al., 2014",,,,,,,,,,,,
Is walkability healthy for all? Using the National Environmental Database to examine equity in the environmental health characteristics of pedestrian-supportive neighborhoods in the U.S.,"Braun, L.M.; Fox, E.H.; Frank, L.D.","Background: Marginalized populations in the U.S. often live in dense urban areas, which could promote active travel and health. However, while compactness can support walkability, it can also create exposure to pollution, noise, injury risk, and urban heat islands. These exposures may be higher for marginalized groups, creating systematic “walkability-related” risks. Objectives: We evaluated relationships between walkability, health-related environmental exposures, and social vulnerability, asking: (1) How are sociodemographic groups sorted across space with respect to walkability? (2) Do the environmental health correlates of walkability vary by social vulnerability? Methods: We compiled block group-level data for the 30 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. We measured walkability using the National Walkability Index; social vulnerability using indicators of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status; and environmental exposures using PM<inf>2.5</inf>, pedestrian fatalities, noise, and tree coverage. We used multilevel mixed-effects regressions to predict (1) walkability as a function of vulnerability and (2) each environmental exposure as a function of the cross-tabulation between walkability and vulnerability. Results: Higher walkability was associated with higher vulnerability. Compared to highly walkable block groups with low vulnerability, those with high vulnerability had higher PM<inf>2.5</inf> and noise levels and lower tree coverage. These differences were even more pronounced among block groups with low walkability, suggesting pervasive inequities. Discussion: While marginalized groups often live in more walkable places, the “high” walkability to which they are exposed carries greater environmental risks than for privileged populations. Our findings illustrate the importance of mitigating environmental burdens that could dampen the health benefits of walkability in marginalized communities. © 2025",2025,Social Science and Medicine,374,,,10.1016/j.socscimed.2025.118024,#718,Braun 2025,"Braun et al., 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,
Social Equity of Street Trees in the Pedestrian Realm,"Brooks, K.R.; Kelley, W.; Amiri, S.","absract: Pedestrian accessibility is a primary component of just and vital urban environments. Presence of usable sidewalks is the foundation of pedestrian accessibility, but their walkability depends on socioeconomic and contextual attributes. The mere presence of a sidewalk might not facilitate its usability or walkability. Use of sidewalks also depends on positive conditions of comfort and safety. In many climates, street trees contribute significantly to comfort and to perceptions of safety. Street trees also provide ecosystem services that benefit humans. Recent efforts to reduce non-point-source pollution through installation of green infrastructure provide opportunities to increase the presence of trees in pedestrian travel ways. Environmental justice considerations imply that accessibility, including sidewalk walkability, be fairly distributed to maximize individual, societal, and environmental benefits and to respond to limitations imposed by socioeconomic status (SES). Our main hypothesis is that SES is negatively correlated with the presence of street trees. This article draws on a microdetailed regional pedestrian data set to characterize the presence of street trees in a social equity context. We found that street trees are inequitably distributed in the study area. These findings could add power to requests for installation of street trees and green infrastructure in lower SES neighborhoods. © 2016, © 2016 Applied Geography Conferences.",2016,Papers in Applied Geography,2,2,216-235,10.1080/23754931.2015.1121163,#4890,Brooks 2016,"Brooks et al., 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do income, race and ethnicity, and sprawl influence the greenspace-human health link in city-level analyses? Findings from 496 cities in the United States","Browning, M.H.E.M.; Rigolon, A.","Examination of the greenspace—human health relationship operates in at least four dimensions: what is considered greenspace? which moderators and mediators are included? what outcomes are measured? and which units of analysis (e.g., individuals, cities) are studied? We examined three of these four dimensions in a cross-sectional study of 496 of the 500 most populated US cities (total population size = 97,574,613, average population per city = 197,920). Spatial average models tested the effect of two greenspace measures (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index greenness and tree cover) on two outcomes (obesity and mental health), while adjusting for income, race and ethnicity, sprawl, age, sex, physical inactivity, median age of housing, and total population. We conducted analyses at the city scale, which is an understudied unit of analysis, and compared findings to individual-and neighborhood-level studies. In two of four models, greenspace was associated with better health. We found race and ethnicity moderated this relationship with varying results. In full sample analyses, cities with greater percentages of non-Hispanic Whites showed links between higher tree cover and lower obesity but marginal relationships between higher greenness and lower obesity. In subsample analyses with majority-non-Hispanic Black cities, higher tree cover was associated with lower obesity and better mental health.

Disparities in Built and Natural Features of Urban Parks: Comparisons by Neighborhood Level Race/Ethnicity and Income,"Bruton, C.M.; Floyd, M.F.","Known associations between the built environment and health outcomes have accelerated research examining racial/ethnic and income disparities in access to parks and other community features that support physical activity. Currently, it cannot be concluded that park characteristics are equal in quantity or condition across areas of disparate race/ethnicity and income composition. This study examined natural and built park characteristics across areas of different race/ethnicity and income composition to identify potential disparities. Twenty-one parks in Greensboro, NC (USA), located in minority or non-minority areas and in low or medium-high income areas were inventoried using a park audit tool and GIS. Parks were compared on number of activity areas, features, amenities, size, percent tree canopy, cleanliness, and condition. Independent sample t tests and Mann–Whitney tests were used to compare means of outcome variables. Fisher’s exact tests were applied for categorical variables. Fewer wooded areas and more trash cans were found in low-income and minority areas as compared to medium-high income and non-minority areas. Low-income areas were found to have more picnic areas than their counterparts. Sitting and resting features in non-minority areas were found to be cleaner than those in minority areas.

Current street tree communities reflect race-based housing policy and modern attempts to remedy environmental injustice,"Burghardt, K.T.; Avolio, M.L.; Locke, D.H.; Grove, J.M.; Sonti, N.F.; Swan, C.M.","Humans promote and inhibit other species on the urban landscape, shaping biodiversity patterns. Institutional racism may underlie the distribution of urban species by creating disproportionate resources in space and time. Here, we examine whether present-day street tree occupancy, diversity, and composition in Baltimore, MD, USA, neighborhoods reflect their 1937 classification into grades of loan risk—from most desirable (A = green) to least desirable (D = “redlined”)—using racially discriminatory criteria. We find that neighborhoods that were redlined have consistently lower street tree α-diversity and are nine times less likely to have large (old) trees occupying a viable planting site. Simultaneously, redlined neighborhoods were locations of recent tree planting activities, with a high occupancy rate of small (young) trees. However, the community composition of these young trees exhibited lower species turnover and reordering across neighborhoods compared to those in higher grades, due to heavy reliance on a single tree species. Overall, while the negative effects of redlining remain detectable in present-day street tree communities, there are clear signs of recent investment. A strategy of planting diverse tree cohorts paired with investments in site rehabilitation and maintenance may be necessary if cities wish to overcome ecological feedbacks associated with legacies of environmental injustice. © 2022 The Authors.

Application of a Global Environmental Equity Index in Montreal: Diagnostic and Further Implications,"Carrier, M.; Apparicio, P.; Kestens, Y.; Sa©guin, A.-M.; Pham, T.-T.-H.; Crouse, D.L.; Siemiatycki, J.","Urban living environments are known to influence human well-being and health. The literature on environmental equity focuses especially on the distribution of nuisances and resources, which, because of the unequal spatial distribution of different social groups, leads to an increased exposure to risks or to less access to beneficial elements for certain populations. Little work has been done on the multidimensionality of different environmental burdens and the lack of resources in some urban environments. This article has two main objectives. The first objective is to construct an environmental equity index that takes into consideration seven components of the urban environment (traffic-related pollutants, proximity to major roads and highways, vegetation, access to parks, access to supermarkets, and the urban heat island effect). The second objective is to determine whether groups vulnerable to different nuisances—namely, individuals under fifteen years old and the elderly—and those who tend to be located in the most problematic areas according to the environmental justice literature (i.e., visible minorities and low-income populations) are affected by environmental inequities associated with the application of the composite index at the city block level. The results obtained by using four statistical techniques show that, on the Island of Montreal, low-income persons and, to a lesser extent, visible minorities are more frequently located in city blocks close to major roads and with higher concentrations of NO<inf>2</inf> and less vegetation. Finally, the environmental equity index is significantly lower in areas with high concentrations of low-income populations in comparison with the wealthiest areas. © 2016 by American Association of Geographers.",2016,Annals of the American Association of Geographers,106,6,1268-1285,10.1080/24694452.2016.1197766,#4833,Carrier 2016,"Carrier et al., 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Optimizing nature-based solutions by combining social equity, hydro-environmental performance, and economic costs through a novel Gini coefficient","Castro, C.V.","A robust multi-functional framework for widespread planning of nature-based solutions (NBS) must incorporate components of social equity and hydro-environmental performance in a cost-effective manner. NBS systems address stormwater mitigation by increasing on-site infiltration and evaporation through enhanced greenspace while also improving various components of societal well-being, such as physical health (e.g., heart disease, diabetes), mental health (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, depression), and social cohesion. However, current optimization tools for NBS systems rely on stormwater quantity abatement and, to a lesser extent, economic costs and environmental pollutant mitigation. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore how NBS planning may be improved to maximize hydrological, environmental, and social co-benefits in an unequivocal and equitable manner. Here, a novel equity-based indexing framework is proposed to better understand how we might optimize social and physical functionalities of NBS systems as a function of transdisciplinary characteristics. Specifically, this study explores the spatial tradeoffs associated with NBS allocation by first optimizing a local watershed-scale model according to traditional metrics of stormwater efficacy (e.g., cost efficiency, hydrological runoff reduction, and pollutant load reduction) using SWMM modeling. The statistical dispersion of social health is then identified using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), which is a high-resolution spatial account of socioeconomic disadvantages that have been linked to adverse health outcomes, according to United States census properties. As NBSs have been shown to mitigate various adverse health conditions through increased urban greening, this improved understanding of geospatial health characteristics may be leveraged to inform an explicit representation of social wellness within NBS planning frameworks. This study presents and demonstrates a novel framework for integrating hydro-environmental modeling, economic efficiency, and social health deprivation using a dimensionless Gini coefficient, which is intended to spur the positive connection of social and physical influences within robust NBS planning. Hydro-environmental risk (according to hydro-dynamic modeling) and social disparity (according to ADI distribution) are combined within a common measurement unit to capture variation across spatial domains and to optimize fair distribution across the study area. A comparison between traditional SWMM-based optimization and the proposed Gini-based framework reveals how the spatial allocation of NBSs within the watershed may be structured to address significantly more areas of social health deprivation while achieving similar hydro-environmental performance and cost-efficiency. The results of a case study for NBS planning in the White Oak Bayou watershed in Houston, Texas, USA revealed runoff volume reductions of 3.45% and 3.38%, pollutant load reductions of 11.15% and 11.28%, and ADI mitigation metrics of 16.84% and 35.32% for the SWMM-based and the Gini-based approaches, respectively, according to similar cost expenditures. As such, the proposed framework enables an analytical approach for balancing the spatial tradeoffs of overlapping human-water goals in NBS planning while maintaining hydro-environmental robustness and economic efficiency. © 2022 The Author(s)",2022,Journal of Hydrology X,16,,,10.1016/j.hydroa.2022.100127,#3016,Castro 2022,"Castro, 2022",,,,,,,,,,,,
Feasibility of afforestation as an equitable nature-based solution in urban areas,"Chakraborty, T; Biswas, T; Campbell, LS; Franklin, B; Parker, SS; Tukman, M","Although nature-based solutions for urban heat mitigation have gained momentum, it is important to quantitatively assess the feasibility of such strategies to utilize space efficiently and prioritize lower-income communities, who have fewer options for climate change adaptation. Here we combine data from US census estimates, satellites, and satellite-derived products to develop a framework to target potentially suitable areas for urban afforestation to mitigate urban heat and minimize tree cover disparity. We test this framework for California and show that space exists for an additional 36 million (1.28 million acres of) trees in the state's urban areas. This would reduce the average urban land surface temperature by 1.8C and provide multiple co-benefits totaling $1.1 billion annually, including reduction in heat-related medical visits (almost 4000 over 10 years) and 4.5 million metric tons of annual CO2 sequestration. Because funding is limited, we provide suitability scores for urban afforestation at the census block group (CBG) scale based on multiple considerations. In California, afforestation in CBGs with positive suitability scores will lead to $712 million of net annual benefits (against an annual investment of $467 million) and will serve 89% of the & AP;9 million urban residents in the lowest income quartile for their cities.

"Urban green space, respiratory health and rising temperatures: An examination of the complex relationship between green space and adult asthma across racialized neighborhoods in Los Angeles County","Chen, P.; Hanlon, B.","Using spatial regressions in Piecewise Structural Equation Modeling, this study aims to investigate the relationship between urban green space (UGS) and adult asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits in urbanized Los Angeles County. Controlling for socioeconomic and built-environment factors at the neighborhood scale, we examine both direct associations between various UGS types—trees, grass, and water bodies—and asthma ED visit rates, as well as indirect pathways through air pollution (PM2.5) and land surface temperature (LST). Our findings reveal distinct pathways through which UGS types are associated with asthma ED visit rates. Proportions of trees and water bodies are negatively associated with asthma ED visit rates through different indirect pathways: trees through both LST and PM2.5 pathways, and water bodies through the LST pathway. Grass proportions, conversely, are positively associated with asthma ED visit rates both directly and indirectly through LST. We also highlight variations in these associations across different racialized communities. Specifically, in predominantly White communities, tree proportions demonstrate an additional direct negative association with asthma ED visit rates, whereas the positive associations between grass proportions and both asthma ED visit rates and LST, observed in minoritized communities of color, are not present. Moreover, the overall positive association between grass proportions and asthma ED visit rates is significantly stronger in minoritized communities of color. This research suggests prioritizing trees and water bodies over grass in green infrastructure planning and advocates for a context-specific approach in urban planning and public health management to optimize the benefits of UGS. © 2025 The Author(s)",2025,Landscape and Urban Planning,258,,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2025.105320,#648,Chen 2025,"Chen & Hanlon, 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,
Environmental justice and park quality in an intermountain west gateway community: assessing the spatial autocorrelation,"Chen, S.; Sleipness, O.R.; Christensen, K.M.; Feldon, D.; Xu, Y.","Context: Research on environmental justice issues, particularly unequal park distribution and quality, has found that communities’ minority density and socioeconomic status (SES) are often correlated with disparate park qualities. However, most studies of spatial relationships between park quality and socioeconomic factors employ simple statistical analyses, which do not account for potential spatial autocorrelations and their effects on validity. Objectives: This study determines whether the distribution of park quality is spatially autocorrelated and assesses the associations among multiple indicators of environmental justice and both separate park features and overall park quality. Methods: This study evaluates spatial relationships between park quality and multiple environmental justice indicators in Cache County, Utah following the spatial regression process conducted in R programming language. Both overall park quality and separate feature qualities were audited by the PARK (Parks, Activity, and Recreation among Kids) tool. Environmental justice indicators included minority density, poverty, unemployment, low-education, renter rate, and yard size. Results: Results illustrate a spatial autocorrelation existing in park quality distribution, detecting the dependence of the variable for quantitative research. They also show significant correlations between park quality and environmental justice indicators. Conclusions: The study’s spatial regression model is a model for analyzing the spatial data and avoids the autocorrelation which is overlooked by the normal statistical approaches. Also, variances of park quality can be accounted for by different environmental justice indicators, such as minority density, poverty, and yard size.

"A comparison of park access with park need for children: A case study in Cache County, Utah","Chen, S.; Christensen, K.M.; Li, S.","Parks are acknowledged as assets for children, but children's access to parks and their quality is often inequitable. Previous studies have focused on disparities in the spatial distribution of parks. The purpose of this study is to explore park access by both the distribution and the quality of parks in relation to children's potential need. This study compared a broader assessment of park access, incorporating both proximity and quality with an index of park need rather than simple population size or a single measure of socio-economic status (SES). While proximity and quality were assessed by Network Analysis and PARK tool respectively, the index of park need was identified through multiple socio-demographic factors and co-variables. Comparison between the measures was both statistical and graphical. The statistical analysis, using multiple linear regression, determined the extent that park access correlated with park need. The graphical analysis identified spatial gaps between the measures. A protocol was built to increase park proximity and quality within these gaps to improve children's park access and meet their potential need for parks. The results of the comparison showed that park need was positively associated with park access to a significant extent (p <.001) accounting for 56% of the relationship.

Trends in socioeconomic disparities in urban heat exposure and adaptation options in mid-sized U.S. cities,"Chen, S.; Bruhn, S.; Seto, K.C.","There is ample evidence that environmental justice communities experience high levels of extreme heat. However, it is unknown how disparities in urban heat exposure and adaptation options change over time. This study investigates socioeconomic disparities over time in urban heat exposure and adaptation options in eight mid-sized Northeastern cities. We ask: How were socioeconomic factors associated with heat exposure and adaptation options over time? We analyzed disparities at the census block group level and census block level, respectively. At the census block group level, we ran spatial regression models between socioeconomic variables, including race, income, gender, and age, and heat exposure and adaptation variables, including land surface temperature, normalized different vegetation index (NDVI), tree cover, and air conditioning ownership rate. We found that: Low median household income is always associated with high LST and low NDVI from 1990 to 2020; Low percentages of females are always associated with high LST and low NDVI from 1990 to 2020. High percentages of POC are associated with high LST in 2010 and 2020, but not in 1990 and 2000; Low median household income and low percentages of elderly are associated with lower tree covers; High percentages of POC, low percentages of elderly, and low median household income are associated with lower AC rates. In analysis at the census block level by city, we found that disparities in urban heat exposure between predominantly POC and predominantly white communities increased in most cities during 1990–2020. Predominantly POC communities consistently have lower vegetation cover over time in most cities. Disparities in vegetation cover per unit area increased in most cities, whereas disparities in vegetation cover per capita decreased in most cities. Our findings of the trends in disparities in heat exposure and adaptation are useful for forecasting disparities in the future. These findings also suggest that interventions should prioritize cities with increasing disparities in heat exposure and adaptation. © 2024",2024,Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment,36,,,10.1016/j.rsase.2024.101313,#1499,Chen 2024,"Chen et al., 2024a",,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the increasing roles nonprofits play in public service provision and urban governance, it is critical to examine how the nonprofit sector may influence the distribution of public services. Combining the literature from urban affairs and nonprofit studies, we propose a theoretical framework to articulate various pathways through which communities with a larger nonprofit sector may create favorable conditions for public services to be distributed to certain racial–ethnic groups. We further test this framework using a unique geospatial dataset of public park access by different racial–ethnic groups in 2,392 U.S. cities.

Assessing the Locational Equity of Community Parks through the Application of Geographic Information Systems,"Comer, JC; Skraastad-Jurney, PD","The need to analytically evaluate the accessibility and equity of publicly provided services is becoming more important as competition for tax dollars and public funds intensifies. Parks and other recreational amenities are especially vulnerable to fluctuating fiscal conditions as welfare, emergency, and health services often take precedence over leisure. Recent research has focused on assessing equity, or providing services in proportion to need, instead of simple equality, or equal access for all. This article uses three common measures of accessibility, minimum distance, travel cost, and the gravity potential, to evaluate how equitably community parks serve various high-need populations in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. Based on past literature and present-day demographic characteristics in Oklahoma City, areas with high concentrations of Hispanics and low-income residents are defined as having the greatest need for access to parks followed by African Americans and Asians. Areas with high concentrations of Hispanics are found to have the highest levels of access to parks followed closely by low income areas, while areas with high percentages of African Americans and Asians do not have as much access. These results indicate a currently equitable distribution of parks, but future plans for Oklahoma City's growth through 2020 will most likely worsen the African American population's relative access. Also, while these results are generally consistent for all three accessibility metrics, we recommend the minimum distance and gravity potential methods for their ability to better discern small-scale patterns. This article reinforces the utility of geo-statistical tools in the public realm of park planning. Past research in the field has been gradually building toward this outcome, as greater attention has been paid to distance calculations (road network versus straight line), diverse accessibility measures (minimum distance, travel cost, gravity potential), and the incorporation of geographic information systems (GIS) into the planning process. The merger of widely available spatial databases with appropriate socio-economic data is a valuable tool for the purpose of evaluating the locational equity of parks with respect to defined need-based groups. This research builds on past work by explicitly incorporating spatial autocorrelation statistics into the analysis process, an approach that identifies zones within the study area that exhibit statistically significant clustering of different socio-economic characteristics and of high or low park access. Correlation of clusters of higher need groups and high or low access areas provides guidance to park planners for both future park development as well as assessment of both the equity as well as the efficiency of the current park system. Spatial autocorrelation statistics integrated into GIS packages such as ArcGIS 9 place more effective tools in reach of researchers and planners seeking to both equitably locate parks as well as to justify their results and decisions to the general public.",2008,JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION,26,1,122-146,,#6878,Comer 2008,"Comer & Skraastad-Jurney, 2008",,,,,,,,,,,,
"The association of green space, tree canopy and parks with life expectancy in neighborhoods of Los Angeles","Connolly, R.; Lipsitt, J.; Aboelata, M.; Yanez, E.; Bains, J.; Jerrett, M.","Substantial evidence suggests that access to urban green spaces and parks is associated with positive health outcomes, including decreased mortality. Few existing studies have investigated the association between green spaces and life expectancy (LE), and none have used small-area data in the U.S. Here we used the recently released U.S. Small-Area Life Expectancy Estimates Project data to quantify the relationship between LE and green space in Los Angeles County, a large diverse region with inequities in park access. We developed a model to quantify the association between green space and LE at the census tract level. We evaluated three green space metrics: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, 0.6-meter scale), percent tree canopy cover, and accessible park acres. We statistically adjusted for 15 other determinants of LE. We also developed conditional autoregressive models to account for spatial dependence. Tree canopy and NDVI were both significantly associated with higher LE. For an interquartile range (IQR) increase in each metric respectively, the spatial models demonstrated a 0.24 to 0.33-year increase in LE. Tree canopy and NDVI also modified the effect of park acreage on LE. ln areas with tree canopy levels below the county median, an IQR increase in park acreage was associated with an increase of 0.12 years. Although on an individual level these effects were modest, we predicted 155,300 years of LE gains across the population in LA County if all areas below median tree canopy were brought to the county median of park acres. If tree canopy or NDVI were brought to median levels, between 570,300 and 908,800 years of LE could be gained. The majority of potential gains are in areas with predominantly Hispanic/Latinx and Black populations. These findings suggest that equitable access to green spaces could result in substantial population health benefits. © 2023 The Authors",2023,Environment International,173,,,10.1016/j.envint.2023.107785,#2551,Connolly 2023,"Connolly et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
"City structure, obesity, and environmental justice: An integrated analysis of physical and social barriers to walkable streets and park access","Cutts, B.B.; Darby, K.J.; Boone, C.G.; Brewis, A.","Local parks and walkable neighborhoods are commonly cited as elements of the urban environment that promote physical activity and reduce obesity risk. When those vulnerable to obesity-related diseases live in neighborhoods without these qualities, it works against environmental justice goals that aim for a fair distribution of amenities. We use geographic information systems (GIS) to evaluate the relationship between the distribution of populations vulnerable to obesity and proximity to parks and walkable street networks in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Though previous studies have used GIS to assess the distribution of access to opportunities for physical activity, none have analyzed access to both parks and walkable resources at once. Neither have they included data that reflects findings on a smaller scale indicating that perceptions of resource quality, safety, and cultural relevance also affect physical activity levels. We include these safety and quality factors in our study through statistical data on traffic fatalities, crime rates and park size. We find that, counter to predictions, subpopulations generally considered vulnerable to obesity (and environmental injustices more generally) are more likely to live in walkable neighborhoods and have better walking access to neighborhood parks than other groups in Phoenix. However, crime is highest in walkable neighborhoods with large Latino/a and African-American populations and parks are smaller in areas populated by Latino/as. Given the higher prevalence of obesity and related diseases in lower income and minority populations in Phoenix, the results suggest that benefits of built environments may be offset by social characteristics. Our most consistent finding indicates a strong negative relationship between the percentage of the population under 18 years of age living in an area and the likelihood that the structure of the built environment supports physical activity. Children under 18 are significantly underrepresented in regions deemed highly walkable and those with access to parks. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in urban green space accessibility: Where to intervene?,"Dai, D.","Access to green spaces is important to physical activities and public health, yet one concern remains as to whether the disparities in green space access exist. This study aimed to (1) introduce an approach to quantify potential spatial accessibility to green spaces in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment; and (2) evaluate the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in green space access. Urban green spaces (n=890) in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia were collected from the Atlanta Regional Commission. A Gaussian-based two-step floating catchment area method was adapted to assess the spatial accessibility to green spaces at the census tract level. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model and the spatial lag model were used to evaluate the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities. Results suggest that the spatial accessibility to green spaces in Atlanta was not evenly distributed. Both models show that neighborhoods with a higher concentration of African Americans had significantly poorer access to green spaces (P<0.05). Asian population had significantly poor access in the OLS model but not in the spatial lag model. Poor access was present in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas as well. Findings can be used for the city and regional planners to target the specific areas for green space development in order to elucidate the disparities. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2011,Landscape and Urban Planning,102,4,234-244,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2011.05.002,#5443,Dai 2011,"Dai, 2011",,,,,,,,,,,,
Green infrastructure and bird diversity across an urban socioeconomic gradient,"Davis, AY; Belaire, JA; Farfan, MA; Milz, D; Sweeney, ER; Loss, SR; Minor, ES","As the world continues to urbanize, ensuring that urban residents have access to green infrastructure and the ecosystem services it provides will be critical. Furthermore, the distribution of green infrastructure within cities should be equitable so that no socioeconomic group is underserved in terms of the benefits derived from ecosystem services. Our goal was to test whether there were any differences among socioeconomic groups in terms of (1) proximity to open space, (2) proximity to Lake Michigan, (3) tree canopy cover, or (4) bird biodiversity in census tracts across Chicago, IL (USA). These four variables were used as proxies for a number of different ecosystem services. We characterized the first three variables with GIS operations using classified Quickbird imagery and other datasets that describe the urban and natural environment. We used MaxEnt to model suitable bird habitat for 52 species that are regularly observed in the area and combined the habitat maps to estimate bird biodiversity in a spatially explicit manner. Our results suggest that census tracts with more low-to mid-income Hispanic residents were farther away from both open space and Lake Michigan, and had less tree canopy cover and bird biodiversity than other census tracts. Tracts characterized mostly by low-income African Americans were not statistically different in terms of proximity to open space, nor in terms of tree canopy cover or bird biodiversity, than those characterized by higher income residents. Those tracts were, however, significantly farther from Lake Michigan compared to the higher income census tracts.

Dimensions of thermal inequity: Neighborhood social demographics and urban heat in the southwestern U.S.,"Dialesandro, J.; Brazil, N.; Wheeler, S.; Abunnasr, Y.","Exposure to heat is a growing public health concern as climate change accelerates world-wide. Different socioeconomic and racial groups often face unequal exposure to heat as well as increased heat-related sickness, mortality, and energy costs. We provide new insight into thermal inequities by analyzing 20 Southwestern U.S. metropolitan regions at the census block group scale for three temperature scenarios (average summer heat, extreme summer heat, and average summer nighttime heat). We first compared average temperatures for top and bottom decile block groups according to demographic variables. Then we used spatial regression models to investigate the extent to which exposure to heat (measured by land surface temperature) varies according to income and race. Large thermal inequities exist within all the regions studied. On average, the poorest 10% of neighborhoods in an urban region were 2.2◦C (4◦F) hotter than the wealthiest 10% on both extreme heat days and average summer days. The difference was as high as 3.3–3.7◦C (6–7◦F) in California metro areas such as Palm Springs and the Inland Empire. A similar pattern held for Latinx neigh-borhoods. Temperature disparities at night were much smaller (usually ~1◦F). Disparities for Black neighborhoods were also lower, perhaps because Black populations are small in most of these cities. California urban regions show stronger thermal disparities than those in other Southwestern states, perhaps because inexpensive water has led to more extensive vegetation in affluent neighborhoods. Our findings provide new details about urban thermal inequities and reinforce the need for programs to reduce the disproportionate heat experienced by disadvantaged communities. © 2021 by the authors.

"Exploring the impact of park features and visitors' socioeconomic status on park visitation: A case study of Austin, Texas","Ding, YZ; Song, Y; Xu, ZC","Urban parks offer significant environmental, social, and economic benefits, and understanding the factors that influence park usage is crucial to maximizing these benefits. Previous research has established that park visitation is associated with park features (e.g. vegetation, access to park, park amenities). However, there is a limited body of research on the relationship between specific park attributes and park usage among different demographics and income groups. To address this research gap, we took Austin, Texas as our study site, and utilized longitudinal individual-level and location-based big data (SafeGraph) to examine how park features, involving park characteristics (i.e. size, age), park natural features (i.e. tree canopy, water), and facilities, influence park usage across demographics and income groups. Our research reveals several key factors that influence park visitation. Median household income, distance to the park, the percentage of married couple households in the block group, and the percentage of people working from home are negatively associated with park visitation. Conversely, the percentage of males, median age, the percentage of children, and the percentage of the population owning houses are positively associated with park visitation. Additionally, we examined the various preferences towards park features across different income groups. The low-income group prefers parks that are newer, with water features, and with swimming pools. Tree canopy is a positive predictor for visitation among the low-income group at the p < 0.1 level. The middle-income group favors parks with scenic viewpoints but not parks with sports facilities. The high-income group is more likely to visit parks with water features. These findings provide valuable insights into how demographic groups prefer park visitation and how park characteristics that may encourage park visitation among different income groups, and they can help guide urban planners, designers, and policymakers in the allocation of parks with specific features to benefit different demographic groups urban residents to the greatest extent.",2025,JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,50,,,10.1016/j.jort.2025.100877,#6781,Ding 2025,"Ding et al., 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,
SOCIO-SPATIAL DISPARITIES IN URBAN GREEN SPACE ACCESSIBILITY: THE EXISTING CHALLENGE FOR TORONTO IN ITS ASPIRATION TO BE A LIVEABLE CITY,"Dong, Z.‘.; Miller, E.J.","Toronto, a thriving multicultural metropolis, aspires to create an inclusive and livable urban environment meeting diverse resident needs. However, challenges arise due to the uneven distribution of urban green spaces. This study employs a gravity model and Gaussian-based 2SFCA model to assess green space accessibility in Toronto’s dissemination areas. A Gini index and local bivariate Moran’s I illuminate socio-spatial disparities, while Geographically Weighted Regression unveils economic inequalities by correlating green space accessibility with housing prices and their five-year growth. Findings expose stark environmental inequity, with the bottom 20% accessing a mere 7% of spaces and the top 20% enjoying 40%. City center and low-income peri-central areas exhibit pronounced disparities, driven by limited green spaces and intense competition. In flourishing, dense areas, residents pay more for increased green space share, while less-dense areas with ample green spaces see higher housing prices where accessibility prevails. Neighborhoods with abundant green spaces and amenities, notably special school programs, attract families, correlating housing price growth with green space accessibility. Considering diverse district development phases and priorities and potential conflicts, tailored strategies for equitable green space systems are recommended citywide. © 2024, Canadian Regional Science Association.

Drought-vulnerable vegetation increases exposure of disadvantaged populations to heatwaves under global warming: A case study from Los Angeles,"Dong, C.; Yan, Y.; Guo, J.; Lin, K.; Chen, X.; Okin, G.S.; Gillespie, T.W.; Dialesandro, J.; MacDonald, G.M.","Urban vegetation is valuable in alleviating local heatwaves. However, drought may decrease vegetation health and limit this cooling effect. Here we use satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) to investigate the sensitivity of urban vegetation to drought in Coastal Greater Los Angeles (CGLA) from 2001 to 2020. We applied four statistical models to analyze the relations between 15 socioeconomic variables and the vegetation's sensitivity to drought. We then examined the changes in the cooling effect of the urban vegetation during drought and non-drought periods using remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) data. The results suggest that economically disadvantaged areas with higher proportions of Hispanics and Blacks are typified by vegetation more sensitive to drought, which is likely linked to inequality in water use. Moreover, these populations experience a lower degree of vegetation cooling effects and higher exposure to heatwaves. The findings of this study imply that the potential of a community's vegetation in mitigating heatwaves is significantly influenced by the socioeconomic conditions of the community. Increasing the resilience of urban vegetation to drought in disadvantaged communities may help promote environmentally sustainable and socially resilient cities under a warming climate. © 2023",2023,Sustainable Cities and Society,93,,,10.1016/j.scs.2023.104488,#2467,Dong 2023,"Dong et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
The geography of recreational open space: Influence of neighborhood racial composition and neighborhood poverty,"Duncan, D.T.; Kawachi, I.; White, K.; Williams, D.R.","The geography of recreational open space might be inequitable in terms of minority neighborhood racial/ethnic composition and neighborhood poverty, perhaps due in part to residential segregation. This study evaluated the association between minority neighborhood racial/ethnic composition, neighborhood poverty, and recreational open space in Boston, Massachusetts (US). Across Boston census tracts, we computed percent non-Hispanic Black, percent Hispanic, and percent families in poverty as well as recreational open space density. We evaluated spatial autocorrelation in study variables and in the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression residuals via the Global Moran's I. We then computed Spearman correlations between the census tract socio-demographic characteristics and recreational open space density, including correlations adjusted for spatial autocorrelation. After this, we computed OLS regressions or spatial regressions as appropriate. Significant positive spatial autocorrelation was found for neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics (all p value = 0.001). We found marginally significant positive spatial autocorrelation in recreational open space (Global Moran's I = 0.082; p value = 0.053). However, we found no spatial autocorrelation in the OLS regression residuals, which indicated that spatial models were not appropriate. There was a negative correlation between census tract percent non-Hispanic Black and recreational open space density (r <inf>S</inf> = -0.22; conventional p value = 0.005; spatially adjusted p value = 0.019) as well as a negative correlation between predominantly non-Hispanic Black census tracts (>60 % non-Hispanic Black in a census tract) and recreational open space density (r <inf>S</inf> = -0.23; conventional p value = 0.003; spatially adjusted p value = 0.007). In bivariate and multivariate OLS models, percent non-Hispanic Black in a census tract and predominantly Black census tracts were associated with decreased density of recreational open space (p value < 0.001). Consistent with several previous studies in other geographic locales, we found that Black neighborhoods in Boston were less likely to have recreational open spaces, indicating the need for policy interventions promoting equitable access.

A spatially explicit approach to the study of socio-demographic inequality in the spatial distribution of trees across Boston neighborhoods.,"Duncan, DT; Kawachi I; Kum S; Aldstadt J; Piras G; Matthews SA; Arbia G; Castro MC; White K; Williams DR","The racial/ethnic and income composition of neighborhoods often influences local amenities, including the potential spatial distribution of trees, which are important for population health and community wellbeing, particularly in urban areas. This ecological study used spatial analytical methods to assess the relationship between neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics (i.e. minority racial/ethnic composition and poverty) and tree density at the census tact level in Boston, Massachusetts (US). We examined spatial autocorrelation with the Global Moran's I for all study variables and in the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression residuals as well as computed Spearman correlations non-adjusted and adjusted for spatial autocorrelation between socio-demographic characteristics and tree density. Next, we fit traditional regressions (i.e. OLS regression models) and spatial regressions (i.e. spatial simultaneous autoregressive models), as appropriate. We found significant positive spatial autocorrelation for all neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics (Global Moran's I range from 0.24 to 0.86, all P=0.001), for tree density (Global Moran's I=0.452, P=0.001), and in the OLS regression residuals (Global Moran's I range from 0.32 to 0.38, all P<0.001). Therefore, we fit the spatial simultaneous autoregressive models. There was a negative correlation between neighborhood percent non-Hispanic Black and tree density (r(S)=-0.19; conventional P-value=0.016; spatially adjusted P-value=0.299) as well as a negative correlation between predominantly non-Hispanic Black (over 60% Black) neighborhoods and tree density (r(S)=-0.18; conventional P-value=0.019; spatially adjusted P-value=0.180). While the conventional OLS regression model found a marginally significant inverse relationship between Black neighborhoods and tree density, we found no statistically significant relationship between neighborhood socio-demographic composition and tree density in the spatial regression models. Methodologically, our study suggests the need to take into account spatial autocorrelation as findings/conclusions can change when the spatial autocorrelation is ignored. Substantively, our findings suggest no need for policy intervention vis-a-vis trees in Boston, though we hasten to add that replication studies, and more nuanced data on tree quality, age and diversity are needed.",2014,Spat Demogr,2,1,29-Jan,10.1007/BF03354902,#5864,Duncan 2014,"Duncan et al., 2014",,,,,,,,,,,,
The Successive Nature of City Parks: Making and Remaking Unequal Access Over Time,"Elliott, J.R.; Korver-Glenn, E.; Bolger, D.","This study examines the historical establishment and shifting residential access to city parks over time. It begins by engaging and extending a theory of urbanization as socioenvironmental succession. It then assembles and analyzes longitudinal data on city park creation and neighborhood change in Houston from 1947 to 2015. Results reveal how socially privileged residents have long enjoyed unequal access to city parks as well as strong influence over where new ones are established. At the same time, growing minority populations have managed to gain more equitable access not by having new parks come to them so much as by moving into neighborhoods where Whites once lived. These dynamics obscure past processes and patterns of inequality while allowing newer, unexpected ones to emerge. We conclude with a discussion of what these findings imply for understanding not just unequal access to city parks but broader processes of urbanization. © 2019 American Sociological Association",2019,City and Community,18,1,109-127,10.1111/cico.12366,#4360,Elliott 2019,"Elliott et al., 2019",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Strategic and integrated planning for healthy, connected cities: Chattanooga case study.","Elwell Bostrom, H; Shulaker, B; Rippon J; Wood R","The United States is facing unprecedented health challenges - such as obesity and cardiovascular disease - many of which are related to a lack of or insufficient physical activity.

Socioeconomic and race/ethnic disparities in observed park quality,"Engelberg, J.K.; Conway, T.L.; Geremia, C.; Cain, K.L.; Saelens, B.E.; Glanz, K.; Frank, L.D.; Sallis, J.F.","Background: Though park presence and access disparities are well studied for their associations with physical activity (PA), disparities in the availability and quality of amenities and facilities within parks have been infrequently examined. Methods: Five hundred forty-three parks from 472 block groups in the Seattle, WA and Baltimore, MD regions were audited using the Environmental Assessment of Public Recreation Spaces (EAPRS) to assess presence and quality (e.g., condition, cleanliness) of amenities (e.g., restrooms, seating) and facilities (e.g., fields, courts). General linear model regressions investigated Census 2000-derived neighborhood race/ethnicity and income main effect and interactive relationships with 7 park quality summary scores: 1) trails, 2) open space, 3) sports facilities, 4) PA facilities count, 5) PA facilities quality, 6) aesthetics, and 7) overall amenities, controlling for park size. The regions were analyzed separately due to differing race/ethnicity distributions. Results: In the Seattle region, neighborhood income was significantly negatively associated with sports quality score (p <.043), PA facilities total count (p <.015) and the overall amenities quality score (p <.004) (unexpected direction). In the Baltimore region, neighborhood race/ethnicity (percent White/non-Hispanic) was significantly positively related to the open spaces quality score (p <.011) (expected direction). A significant income-by-race/ethnicity interaction was found for PA facilities quality (p =.014), with high-percent minority neighborhoods having higher quality parks in high- vs. low-income neighborhoods, yet was opposite in mostly White/non-Hispanic neighborhoods. The other income-by-race/ethnicity interaction was for overall amenities quality score (p =.043), where scores in high-percent minority neighborhoods were best in high- vs. low-income neighborhoods. There was little difference in scores within mostly White or mixed neighborhoods by income. Conclusions: Patterns of association of neighborhood race/ethnicity and income with park qualities differed between regions. In the Seattle region, ""equitable differences"" were found, where lower income neighborhoods had better park quality on average. In the Baltimore region, park quality was more consistently negatively associated with income and race/ethnic diversity, and complex interactions of race/ethnicity by income were detected. These findings emphasize the need to explore other factors that may explain variations in park quality, like local policy, citizen involvement in park decision-making, park funding and allocation, sources of funding and park priorities. © 2016 Engelberg et al.",2016,BMC Public Health,16,1,,10.1186/s12889-016-3055-4,#4885,Engelberg 2016,"Engelberg et al., 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,
Beyond the 15-minute city dichotomy: Time-denominated access to essential services in Chicago,"Ermagun, A.; Janatabadi, F.; Witlox, F.","This study examines social and spatial disparities in time-denominated access to employment opportunities, schools, parks, hospitals, grocery stores, and transit stations by walking, biking, and transit within the City of Chicago. It goes beyond the conventional 15-minute access dichotomy to recognize and understand the “where,” “what,” and “who” of access disparities in pursuit of equitable and sustainable urban environments. Five observations are discerned. First, 43% of Chicago is already within the 15-minute threshold, a proportion comparable to European cities (e.g., Helsinki, Berlin). Second, locations along major transit routes exhibit relatively longer travel times to access valued destinations. Third, Chicagoans have relatively greater access to employment opportunities and transit stations compared to grocery stores and hospitals. Fourth, there is a racial disparity in time-denominated access among racial minorities beyond the dichotomy of white and non-white. Fifth, disparities in access across generations are both detrimental and benign. The findings bring to the forefront multiple important considerations: (i) the 15-minute threshold is arbitrary, and its dichotomy obscures subtle disparities between areas; (ii) the definition of “essential services” is subjective and context dependent; (iii) not all essential services are prioritized equally when individuals and households choose residential locations; and (iv) access barriers extend beyond mobility and destination choices and may sometimes be rooted in social causes (e.g., safety concerns). © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2025,Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice,195,,,10.1016/j.tra.2025.104428,#737,Ermagun 2025,"Ermagun et al., 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,
Land use and socio-economic determinants of urban forest structure and diversity,"Fan, C.; Johnston, M.; Darling, L.; Scott, L.; Liao, F.H.","The spatial distribution of urban greenness within a city is largely influenced by land use configuration and social factors. This study builds upon previous research focusing on urban forest patterns in relation to land use and socio-economic determinants, while expanding the set of measures used to represent the forest structure. Instead of focusing on canopy cover alone, this study examines two additional attributes, stem density and species diversity, and evaluates the relative importance of land use and socio-economic indicators in determining the urban forest structure in Cook County, Illinois. A combination of remotely sourced data sets and tree records from field surveys are used collectively in addressing the following hypotheses: (H<inf>0</inf>) Canopy cover alone sufficiently describes the predominant forest patterns in Cook County, (H<inf>1</inf>) Forest structure measured as described by canopy cover, stem density, and species diversity, varies across census tracts, and (H<inf>2</inf>) Spatial variability is explained by the land use distributions and a defined set of socio-economic variables. Our results show that the land use and socio-economic factors are better correlates with canopy cover and stem density than species diversity. Overall, Cook County's urban forest is unevenly distributed across census tracts, with wealth, education, racial composition, and home ownership playing different roles in shaping the forest structure.

There is a substantial statistical negative relationship between median household income and the percent of street trees under stress, which provided the evidence of the inequities of street tree quality in Washington D.C. Higher-income neighborhoods exhibited a lower proportion of street trees under stress. In addition, the extreme summer temperature is positively associated with the proportion of street trees under stress. The quality of street trees is directly impacted by environmental and landscape pattern factors. There is also an indirect impact from socioeconomic factor toward quality of street trees.

"Analysing access to parks and other green spaces on walking, biking, and driving networks through a socioeconomic lens","Ferenchak, N.N.; Barney, A.","Green spaces are important elements of cities due to their benefits to residents’ physical health, mental health and development, and social connections. Residents are more likely to experience green space benefits when they use them frequently and usage increases when amenities are accessible. Because lower-income households often have less reliable access to automobiles, examining access solely on the road network is inadequate. Do households across the socioeconomic spectrum have access to green space on pedestrian and bicycle networks? After estimating residential locations (origins) from U.S. Census data and park and other green space locations (destinations) from the City of Albuquerque data, we connect the two using service area network analyses in a geographic information system (GIS). Findings suggest that overall green space access is a concern since less than 50% of Albuquerque residents have access to a green space within 400 m, indicating levels below those recommended by the World Health Organization. Park accessibility is relatively equally distributed for low-, middle-, and high-income households across both pedestrian and road networks. Access to other green space is a source of possible inequity with high-income households having more than five times the access to non-park green spaces than low-income households. The bike network presents another source of possible inequity as 39% of high-income households have access to the bike network versus only 30% of low-income households and an expansion of the bike network is a primary recommendation for increasing access in an equitable fashion. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2024,Local Environment,29,5,663-679,10.1080/13549839.2023.2300949,#2106,Ferenchak 2024,"Ferenchak & Barney, 2024",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Baltimore street tree distribution and condition relate to socioeconomic factors, while tree diversity and size relate to neighborhood environmental conditions","Fleming, T.(.; Avolio, M.; Sonti, N.F.; Locke, D.H.","Street tree diversity and distribution are often associated with socioeconomic factors like race and income, but distribution of planting sites, street tree condition, and more nuanced biodiversity metrics such as evenness and beta diversity have been less well studied. Motivated by previous findings that street tree communities reflect historical redlining practices, we examined the relationship between present-day socio-environmental characteristics and street tree diversity, condition, and stocking levels in neighborhoods of Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Street tree stocking rates were positively associated with percent White population, income, and educational attainment, and negatively associated with percent Black population. Neighborhoods with more impervious surface cover and hotter air temperatures also had smaller trees, lower species richness and evenness, and a lower percentage of planting sites meeting the Baltimore City Forestry Division’s target size. Neighborhoods with higher air temperatures had more similar street tree community composition. Air temperature, income, race, and educational attainment were all significant factors differentiating street tree community composition. Trees in poor and dead condition were positively correlated with percent Black population, while trees in good condition were positively correlated with percent White population, income, and educational attainment. Results demonstrate that the distribution and quality of Baltimore’s street trees are associated with social and environmental factors.

Exploring a Just and Diverse Urban Forests’ Capacity for Mitigating Future Mean Radiant Temperatures,"Flohr, T.; Garcia, L.; Figueiredo, C.; Heris, M.; Hoffman, M.; Lindeman, J.; Wu, H.; Richardson, L.","The Pittsburgh Metropolitan Region in Western Pennsylvania, U.S., like many cities globally, historically has an inequitably distributed urban forest and faced street tree biodiversity challenges. Additionally, Pittsburgh faces several barriers and threats to maintaining and expanding its urban tree cover, including pests, diseases, social acceptance, built environment obstacles, and climate change. To address these concerns, in 2012, Pittsburgh created an Urban Forest Master Plan setting equitable forest cover and biodiversity benchmarks. This paper documents the status of achieving these benchmarks and uses microclimate simulations to assess the capacity of these benchmarks in mitigating future mean radiant temperatures. Results demonstrate that the story of Pittsburgh’s urban forest cover, street tree biodiversity, and age diversity is complex, but inequities are primarily driven by income. However, if Pittsburgh can achieve its forest cover benchmarks, it can reduce its neighbourhoods’ 2050 mean radiant temperature below 2010 temperatures, even under climate change-fuelled extreme heat events. The process and results reported in this paper allow designers and decision-makers to calibrate localized urban forest benchmarks more effectively based on various future scenarios while ensuring the equitable distribution of heat mitigation. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH.",2024,Journal of Digital Landscape Architecture,2024,9,302-313,10.14627/537752028,#2043,Flohr 2024,"Flohr et al., 2024",,,,,,,,,,,,
Sociodemographic correlates of greenness within public parks in three U.S. cities,"Fossa, A.J.; Zelner, J.; Bergmans, R.; Zivin, K.; Adar, S.D.","Equitable access to urban vegetation (also known as greenness), an environmental determinant of health, is an important environmental justice issue. Researchers often consider parks a source of greenness but there is a lack of research explicitly investigating the sociodemographic correlates of greenness within city parks. Using a high-resolution landcover dataset, publicly available park boundaries, and American Community Survey data, we investigated the relationship between greenness within urban public parks and the sociodemographic characteristics of surrounding neighborhoods. We found that parks were substantially greener than surrounding neighborhoods and that Black race, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and socioeconomic deprivation was associated with less tree canopy and more grass and impervious surface or soil within parks. Public parks are indeed an important source of greenness for urban populations, but the type of vegetation in those spaces depends on the city and sociodemographic characteristics of neighborhoods. Future research and interventions should consider both the type and amount of vegetation within parks. © 2023",2023,"Wellbeing, Space and Society",5,,,10.1016/j.wss.2023.100157,#2230,Fossa 2023,"Fossa et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
An environmental justice analysis of urban tree canopy distribution and change,"Foster, A.; Dunham, I.M.; Bukowska, A.","Many cities are working to increase greenspace and tree canopy to improve residents’ quality of life. However, from an environmental justice perspective, it is important to ask where greenspace is increased and whose quality of life is improved. This research investigates the environmental justice implications of urban tree canopy distribution and change in Philadelphia. Specifically, we conduct three distinct, yet interrelated analyses: (1) an evaluation of the environmental justice implications of Philadelphia’s 2018 tree canopy distribution, (2) a description of tree canopy change in the city between 2008 and 2018, and (3) an assessment of the environmental justice implications of tree canopy change during this period. Thus, our study expands upon previous urban forest environmental justice research by evaluating the environmental justice implications of current tree canopy distribution and temporal changes in tree canopy coverage. We found that neighborhoods in Philadelphia with higher proportions of racialized minorities had lower levels of tree canopy coverage in 2018 and were less likely to gain tree canopy between 2008 and 2018. We argue that cities should use past changes in urban tree canopy, along with an understanding of the current distribution, to make future cities more green and just. © 2022 Urban Affairs Association.",2024,Journal of Urban Affairs,46,3,493-508,10.1080/07352166.2022.2083514,#2148,Foster 2024,"Foster et al., 2024",,,,,,,,,,,,
Monitoring canopy quality and improving equitable outcomes of urban tree planting using LiDAR and machine learning,"Francis, J.; Disney, M.; Law, S.","Urban tree canopies are fundamental to mitigating the impacts of climate change within cities as well as providing a range of other important ecosystem, health, and amenity benefits. However, urban tree planting initiatives do not typically utilize data about both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the tree canopy, despite height being a critical determinant of the quality and value of urban canopy cover. We present a novel pipeline that uses airborne LiDAR data to train a multi-task machine learning model to generate estimates of both canopy cover and height in urban areas. We apply this to multi-source multi-spectral imagery for the case study of Chicago, USA. Our results indicate that a multi-task UNet convolutional neural network can be used to generate reliable estimates of canopy cover and height from aerial and satellite imagery. We then use these canopy estimates to allocate 75,000 trees from Chicago's recent green initiative under four scenarios, minimizing the urban heat island effect and then optimizing for an equitable canopy distribution, comparing results when only canopy cover is used, and when both canopy cover and height are considered. Through the introduction of this novel pipeline, we show that including canopy height within decision-making processes allows the distribution of new trees to be optimised to further reduce the urban heat island effect in localities where trees have the highest cooling potential and allows trees to be more equitably distributed to communities with lower quality canopies. © 2023 The Authors",2023,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,89,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2023.128115,#2261,Francis 2023,"Francis et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
Monitoring changes in walkability over time: An environmental exposure change detection framework with implications for equity and social justice,"Frank, L.D.; Wali, B.","Evidence suggests that walkability and greenspace impact travel related activity patterns and vehicle emissions which affect sustainability, public health, and equity. Resulting levels of physical activity, active, or sedentary travel time impact obesity, diabetes, and heart disease which impact COVID-19 mortality. It is now possible to track changes in locally controlled land use characteristics known to impact sustainability and health. This information can provide decisionmakers with feedback required to spatially prioritize and better link state and nationally funded transportation investments with locally sanctioned land use actions. Linking the achievement of established benchmarks of health equity-based indicators with funding establishes a more performance-based approach connecting land use with transportation investment. This study longitudinally tracks neighborhood-level walkability features at the census tract level for 2013 and 2020 for the entire USA. Longitudinal volatility-based change detection models are developed to examine how changes in walkability over time correlate with racialization and social justice. Walkability tends to increase over time with significant variations across metro regions and the urban-rural continuum. Largest and smallest increases in walkability were observed in Western Pacific and Northwest states, respectively. Increased racial and social justice disparities were observed in access to more walkable infrastructure by marginalized populations (such as less-educated, older, unemployed, and black individuals). Significant heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of walkability was observed, over the variation captured by observed sociodemographic, regional, and urban/rural factors. The findings highlight the potential for an “environmental surveillance” system to support a “performance-based” approach to transportation funding that prioritizes resource allocation consistent with Justice40 and United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. © 2024",2024,Sustainable Cities and Society,117,,,10.1016/j.scs.2024.105808,#1330,Frank 2024,"Frank & Wali, 2024",,,,,,,,,,,,
How far I'll go: Social infrastructure accessibility and proximity in urban neighborhoods,"Fraser, T.; Feeley, O.; Ridge, A.; Cervini, A.; Rago, V.; Gilmore, K.; Worthington, G.; Berliavsky, I.","Recent studies have shown that social infrastructure – community spaces, places of worship, social businesses, and parks – help build social ties, mitigate political polarization, and improve our health. This exploratory study examines why some areas in American cities see greater access to social infrastructure than others, applying geospatial models and city block analyses to the case of Boston. We hypothesize that neighborhoods of color and lower-income neighborhoods might see lower levels of access to social infrastructure, which have significant implications for the health and resilience of these neighborhoods. Using analyses of proximity on a large-N dataset of (1) all social infrastructure sites in Boston and (2) every building in Boston, we measure the distance between every building and social infrastructure site in the city, and model the associations of neighborhood demographics, socioeconomic status, and urban design factors on median distance from social infrastructure. Finally, we demonstrate findings using hyperlocal case studies of 3 iconic city blocks in Boston, examining Back Bay, Nubian Square, and Mount Bowdoin.

Results show that both Blacks and Latinos are overrepresented in census block groups (CBGs) within 1 mile of industrial facilities, while Whites are underrepresented. Conversely, Latinos and those near or below poverty are, on average, underrepresented in communities within one-quarter mile of parkland, but Whites are overrepresented.

Green space justice amid COVID-19: Unequal access to public green space across American neighborhoods,"Gao, S.; Zhai, W.; Fu, X.","Countries around the world have resorted to issuing stay-at-home orders to slow viral transmission since the COVID-19 pandemic. During the lockdown, access to public park plays a central role in the public health of surrounding communities. However, we know little about how such an unprecedented policy may exacerbate the preexisting unequal access to green space (i.e., green space justice). To address this research void, we used difference-in-difference models to examine socioeconomic disparities, urban-rural disparities, and mobility disparities in terms of public park access in the United States. Our national analysis using the weekly mobile phone movement data robustly suggests the following three key findings during COVID-19: (1) The elderly, non-college-educated people, poor people, and blacks are less likely to visit public parks frequently, while unemployed people appear to be the opposite. (2) Compared to rural areas, populations in urban neighborhoods appear to visit public parks more frequently and they generally go to larger parks to minimize the risk of infection. (3) Populations in neighborhoods with higher private vehicle ownership or those with a higher density of transit stops would more frequently visit and travel a longer distance to public parks during the stay-at-home order. Our results imply that conventional inequality in green space access may still exist and even become worse during COVID-19, which could negatively impact people's health during isolation.

A CRITICAL RACE THEORY ANALYSIS of PUBLIC PARK FEATURES in LATINO IMMIGRANT NEIGHBORHOODS,"Garcia, J.J.; Gee, G.C.; Jones, M.","The present-day location of public parks should be understood in the proper social and historical context of residential segregation and urban development. In Los Angeles, discriminatory practices such as restrictive covenants were used not only for housing, but also to maintain segregated recreational spaces. In addition, the economic changes that came as a result of White flight, suburbanization, and inner city job loss brought with it a reduction in local government resources, including funds for public parks. These changes to the urban landscape disproportionately impacted low-income immigrant communities, including Latino neighborhoods. Health disparities researchers are concerned with the inequitable distribution of parks and recreation facilities because it may contribute to disparities in physical inactivity and obesity, health risks that disproportionately impact Latinos. However, much of the literature investigating disparities in the built environment fails to include a racial analysis. The current study uses a Critical Race Theory framework to examine disparities in park availability in Los Angeles. We used a unique park dataset created in ArcGIS to carry out a county-wide assessment of the availability of park features at the neighborhood level. Data come from two sources, the Los Angeles County Location Management System, which includes information on specific park features (e.g., swimming pools, parks and gardens, recreation centers) and the American Community Survey, which includes neighborhood-level sociodemographic information. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression model was used to test whether Latino immigrant neighborhood characteristics are associated with the availability of park features in Los Angeles. Results indicate that Latino immigrant neighborhoods have limited park availability.

Seeing the park for the trees: New York’s “Million Trees” campaign vs. the deep roots of environmental inequality,"Garrison, J.D.","Trees provide many environmental benefits, but low-income communities of color tend to have fewer of them. New York City attempted to correct this disparity by planting a million trees via public–private partnership between 2007 and 2015. This paper examines MillionTreesNYC’s environmental justice goals and planting strategies via program documents and interviews with program partners, and assesses equity outcomes via regression analysis of new trees planted, existing tree canopy, park space, and sociodemographic characteristics measured at the level of the census block group. Ultimately, MillionTreesNYC did not prioritize low-income communities of color to a measurable degree, and planted more trees in areas with greater existing tree canopy. Despite public–private partnerships’ reputation for prioritizing profit over equity, the problem was not a lack of commitment to environmental justice. Instead, MillionTreesNYC’s focus on parks, which are themselves inequitably distributed, frustrated the city’s efforts to equalize the urban forest. This paper therefore exposes the deep historical roots of environmental injustice, which are difficult to eradicate without careful attention to both past and present socio-spatial inequities. © The Author(s) 2017.",2019,Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science,46,5,914-930,10.1177/2399808317737071,#4307,Garrison 2019,"Garrison, 2019",,,,,,,,,,,,

Environmental equity is child's play: mapping public provision of recreation opportunities in urban neighbourhoods,"Gilliland, J; Holmes, M; Irwin, JD; Tucker, P","This paper examines the spatial distribution of recreational opportunities for children and youth in a mid-sized Canadian city (London, Ontario), in relation to the socioeconomic status of neighbourhoods and estimated local need for publicly provided recreation spaces.

To explore potential socio-environmental inequities, neighbourhoods (N = 22) were characterized by socioeconomic and environmental variables, an index of neighbourhood social distress, a neighbourhood play space needs index, and measures of the prevalence and density of recreational opportunities. The results of the spatial analysis indicate there is no systematic socioenvironmental inequity with respect to the prevalence and density of publicly provided neighbourhood recreation spaces; however, there are several areas in the city where youth do not have access to formal play spaces. We argue that to promote physical activity among urban children and youth, city planners and health policy analysts should consider carefully the geographical distribution of existing recreational opportunities and ensure that new publicly funded recreation spaces are provided to neighbourhoods with the greatest need.

"COVID-19, green space exposure, and mask mandates","Grigsby-Toussaint, D.S.; Shin, J.C.","Introduction: Mask-wearing and social distancing are critical prevention measures that have been implemented to stem the spread of COVID-19. The degree to which these measures are adhered to in the US, however, may be influenced by access to outdoor resources such as green space, as well as mask mandates that may vary by state. Purpose: To examine the association between the presence or absence of statewide mask mandates and green space exposure with COVID-19 cumulative incidence in the US. Methods: In October 2020, COVID-19 case data for each US county was downloaded from USA Facts, in addition to statewide mask mandates from a database maintained by the American Association of Retired Persons. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from the US Geological Survey (USGS), was used as a measure of greenspace, while the 2016 National Land Cover Database was used to assess tree canopy exposure as an alternative measure of greenspace. We performed generalized linear regression to evaluate associations with COVID-19 incidence, adjusting for potential confounders such as other environmental factors (i.e., air pollution and climate) and socio-economic factors derived from the CDC social vulnerability index. In addition, we also performed spatial regression analyses to account for spatial autocorrelation across counties. Results: Counties with mandatory mask-wearing policies had a lower cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (B = −0.299, SE = 0.038). Among environmental factors, precipitation (B = 0.005, SE = 0.001) and PM 2.5 (B = 0.072, SE = 0.012) were associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19, while tree canopy (B = −0.501, SE = 0.129) was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19. COVID-19 incidence was higher in counties with socially vulnerable populations regarding socioeconomic status, minority status, and housing and transportation. Conclusion: Mandatory mask regulation, exposure to green space, and reduced exposure to air pollution may reduce COVID-19 incidence in the US. Additional public health policies should consider ways to mitigate environmental conditions that may contribute to the risk of COVID-19, especially for vulnerable populations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,Science of the Total Environment,836,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155302,#2987,Grigsby-Toussaint 2022,"Grigsby-Toussaint & Shin, 2022",,,,,,,,,,,,
How spatial patterns affect urban green space equity at different equity levels: A Bayesian quantile regression approach,"Guan, J.; Wang, R.; Van Berkel, D.; Liang, Z.","In many cities, urban green space (UGS) is not evenly distributed, and marginalized communities often lack UGS due to legacies of disinvestment. Existing research mainly focused on the effect of socioeconomic factors to understand the disparity in access to UGS. However, little is known on how spatial patterns affect UGS equality at the regional and subregional levels. Moreover, the potential quantile effects in the UGS pattern and equality relationship remain unclear. Here, we explored how UGS equality varied among UGS spatial patterns and socioeconomic gradients in seven counties (1,227 census tracts) in Southeast Michigan. First, we quantified UGS equality of each tract with a spatially explicit Gini coefficient and UGS spatial patterns via landscape metrics. Then, we applied a Bayesian quantile regression model to investigate the nonlinear relationship between spatial pattern and UGS equality in the whole study area and its three subregions of different population density. Our results showed that spatial patterns had quantile effects on UGS equality. At the regional scale, patch density and the largest patch index had significant positive effects on UGS equality at all equality levels. The mean patch shape index positively correlated with UGS equality in areas with higher equality level (Gini coefficient: 0.52–0.92). At the subregional level, patch density most efficiently predicted UGS equality in densely populated areas, while the largest patch index also affected UGS equality in areas with low population density. We suggest policymakers should focus on areas with extremely unequal access to UGS to increase the number rather than the cumulative area of UGS. Besides, more linear and irregular UGS patches with longer perimeters have potential to serve more communities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023,Landscape and Urban Planning,233,,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2023.104709,#2493,Guan 2023,"Guan et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed seven diverse elements of park quality (transportation access, facility availability, facility quality, amenity availability, park aesthetics, park quality concerns, and neighborhood quality concerns), as well as an overall park quality score by calculating the mean for all parks within each block group. The mean percent of residents below 125% of the poverty level and the percentage of renter-occupied housing units were significantly higher among block groups with any parks in comparison to block groups with no parks. In addition, there were significant positive associations between park transportation access scores and both the percentage of residents with less than high school education and the percent identifying as non-Hispanic white. Moreover, there was a significant negative association between park amenity availability and the block group’s unemployed population.

Affluent neighborhoods had cooler summer temperatures that reduced exposure to outdoor heat-related health risks, especially during a heat wave period.

Developing a green infrastructure equity index to promote equity planning,"Heckert, M; Rosan, CD","The Philadelphia Water Department has committed to taking a green infrastructure (GI) approach to reduce stormwater runoff and prevent combined sewer overflow events. Promoting GI as a stormwater management technique in a city necessitates development of a more distributed urban environmental management system, through which the city's water department needs to coordinate with a wide range of public and private stakeholders, shifting power from the utility to these other stakeholders. We argue that distributed urban environmental management can lead to more inclusive outcomes but only if there is an intentionality about how funds are distributed, which communities are prioritized, how partners are chosen and cultivated, and which types of projects are implemented in which neighborhoods. We suggest the development of an equity index to help identify communities that would most benefit from GI investment as critical for equitable GI planning. Using Philadelphia as a test case, we develop a Green Infrastructure Equity Index, designed with the indirect benefits of green infrastructure in mind, to determine which communities could benefit the most from investment in GI based on their ""equity void ranking"". We argue that developing a GI Equity Index provides a much more nuanced analysis of communities that takes into account the built environment as well as the underlying social and economic conditions. The GI Equity Index also allows for a shift in the way we define equity. In doing so, it (1) changes the conversation about equity in GI planning using careful data analysis that takes into account both socio-economic and built environment variables; (2) provides a visual tool that communities can use to understand underlying conditions and the existing placement of GI; and (3) serves as a framework that can be tailored to allow communities to weight their priorities, putting more power in their hands.

Access and Equity in Greenspace Provision: A Comparison of Methods to Assess the Impacts of Greening Vacant Land,"Heckert, M","This research explores three methods of measuring access to greenspace in Philadelphia and their implications for assessing equity in access based on race and socioeconomic status. These three methods are then used to assess the impacts of a vacant land greening program which turns vacant lots into temporary greenspaces. This research explores the differences between findings when access to greenspace is measured based on distance to any greenspace, total amount of greenspace to which residents have access, or a hybrid measure in which access is determined based on proximity to a threshold amount of greenspace. Not only do assessments of equity differ between the three approaches, but so do determinations of the impact of greening vacant land. Blacks, Hispanics and renters are more likely to live close to a public greenspace than whites or homeowners, but live in proximity to smaller overall amounts of greenspace. Greening vacant land increases the proportion of all residents who live within walking distance of a greenspace and lessens but does not eliminate differences in total greenspace access. The greatest effects of greening vacant land are seen in addressing differences in relative likelihood of having access to a threshold amount of greenspace.",2013,TRANSACTIONS IN GIS,17,6,808-827,10.1111/tgis.12000,#7670,Heckert 2013,"Heckert, 2013",,,,,,,,,,,,
Investigation on urban greenspace in relation to sociodemographic factors and health inequity based on different greenspace metrics in 3 US urban communities,"Heo, S.; Bell, M.L.","Background: Study results are inconclusive regarding how access to greenspace differs by sociodemographic status potentially due to lack of consideration of varying dimensions of greenspace. Objective: We investigated how provision of greenspace by sociodemographic status varies by greenspace metrics reflecting coverage and accessibility of greenspace. Methods: We used vegetation levels measured by Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), percent of greenspace, percent tree cover, percent tree cover along walkable roads, and percent of people living ≤500 m of a park entrance (park accessibility). We considered data for 2008–2013 in Census block groups in 3 US regions: New Haven, Connecticut; Baltimore, Maryland; and Durham, North Carolina. We examined geographical distribution of greenspace metrics and their associations with indicators of income, education, linguistic isolation, race/ethnicity, and age. We used logistic regression to examine associations between these greenspace metrics and age-standardized mortality controlling for sociodemographic indicators. Results: Which region had the highest greenspace depended on the greenspace metric used. An interquartile range (33.6%) increase in low-income persons was associated with a 6.2% (95% CI: 3.1, 9.3) increase in park accessibility, whereas it was associated with 0.03 (95% CI: −0.035, −0.025) to 7.3% (95% CI: −8.7, −5.9) decreases in other greenspace metrics. A 15.5% increase in the lower-education population was associated with a 2.1% increase (95% CI: −0.3%, 4.6%) in park accessibility but decreases with other greenspace metrics (0.02 to 5.0%). These results were consistent across the 3 study areas. The odds of mortality rate more than the 75th percentile rate were inversely associated with all greenspace metrics except for annual average EVI (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 0.43, 3.79) and park accessibility (OR 1.40, 95% CI: 0.52, 3.75). Significance: Environmental justice concerns regarding greenspace differ by the form of natural resources, and pathways of health benefits can differ by form of greenspace and socioeconomic status within communities. Impact statement: Comparisons of exposure to greenspace between different greenspace metrics should be incorporated in decision-making within local contexts. © 2022, The Author(s).",2023,Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology,33,2,218-228,10.1038/s41370-022-00468-z,#2562,Heo 2023,"Heo & Bell, 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Urban parks, environmental justice, and voluntarism: The distribution of friends of the parks groups in Milwaukee County","Holifield, R.; Williams, K.C.","In many cities, urban parks have emerged as an important environmental justice issue. Parks in predominantly lower-income and minority areas are frequently smaller, with fewer amenities, and they are often beset by neglect or problems with crime or perceptions of crime. As public funding for parks has declined, urban park systems are increasingly turning to volunteers and volunteer organizations to perform important functions. Consequently, the achievement and preservation of environmental justice may depend on ensuring that parks in neglected areas are served by active volunteers. We analyze the distribution of Friends of the Parks volunteer groups in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. We find that most parks in the County lack Friends groups, regardless of demographic characteristics in the surrounding neighborhood, and we find that parks in all parts of this highly segregated county have Friends groups. However, our findings indicate that Friends groups are more likely to remain active at larger parks more common within affluent, predominantly white neighborhoods, while Friends groups are more likely to become inactive at smaller parks more typical in inner-city communities. As public funding for parks continues to decline, we propose that an important environmental justice priority for urban parks systems will be to find ways to keep groups active and engaged at smaller inner-city parks. © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2014,Environmental Justice,7,3,70-76,10.1089/env.2013.0043,#5099,Holifield 2014,"Holifield & Williams, 2014",,,,,,,,,,,,
Put a park on it: How freeway caps are reconnecting and greening divided cities,"Houston, D.; Zuiga, M.E.","The international green infrastructure literature has examined rails-to-trails and freeway-to-boulevard conversions, but these strategies can be impractical or politically unfeasible. An understudied movement among United States cities has demonstrated a strategy for greening freeways that remain in service: freeway cap parks, or decks with parks built in the air space directly above below-grade freeway sections that can help reintegrate communities, conceal traffic, reduce air pollution, and provide green space. We provide the first assessment of the design, function, and placement of freeway cap parks and assess the emerging sustainability discourse of cap park planning. We examine 18 completed and 9 proposed cap parks in 24 U.S. cities to identify four cap park development models that can be adapted worldwide to green below-grade freeway segments and reconnect communities. Given historic disparities in freeway placement, we examined the distribution of cap parks and found they are located in areas that could help address disparities in park access in freeways corridors. Our detailed case studies stress the struggle within the cap park sustainability discourse to balance economic, environmental, and equity concerns. Dallas’ Klyde Warren Park is an economic success story, but illustrates how developers use cap parks to sideline equity concerns. Denver's proposed I-70 cap park illustrates strategies to mitigate environmental justice impacts of freeway expansion projects, but equity concerns remain given continuing impacts of the expanded freeway system. Cap parks should be embraced as a vital component of green infrastructure that reconnects and greens cities divided by freeway construction, but planners should take strong steps to address housing affordability and gentrification concerns for adjacent communities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2019,Cities,85,,98-109,10.1016/j.cities.2018.08.007,#4381,Houston 2019,"Houston & Zuiga, 2019",,,,,,,,,,,,
A multi-dimensional classification and equity analysis of an urban park system: A novel methodology and case study application,"Ibes, D.C.","This study introduces a novel, multidimensional methodology for empirically classifying urban parks according to their physical, land cover, and built features. An equity analysis compares the resulting park types to neighborhood social characteristics, statistically and spatially evaluating who has access to which kind of park. The process can be customized to the built, geographic, and social conditions and public policy goals of other cities, but is here applied to Phoenix, Arizona. The case study application provides a proof of concept, revealing the composition and distribution of various park types and demonstrating the utility and feasibility of the classification procedure and equity analysis. Results reveal five distinct park types in Phoenix - Suburban Amenity Parks, Green Mini Parks, Native Desert Preserves, Green Neighborhood Parks, and Urban Core Parks - each exhibiting a unique mix of physical, spatial, land cover, and built characteristics.

Social inequalities in green exposure in small- and medium-sized U.S. cities: A mobility-based approach,"Jang, K.M.; Kim, J.","Background: Green space exposure has been considered essential for people's physical and mental health. Researchers have investigated uneven exposure to green space based on individuals' home locations, which may exacerbate health disparities. A mobility-based approach enables a more accurate assessment of green exposure in daily activity patterns. In addition, social inequalities may vary by geographical context and should be examined to address environmental justice concerns. Objective: Study objectives are twofold: to address methodological challenges in exposure assessment studies through mobility-based assessment of green exposure; and to explore whether mobility-based approach can better assess green exposure inequality than home-based measurement. Methods: We selected 25 small- and medium-sized U.S. cities as study sites, from which street-view images were collected along 50,823 walk-based commute trajectories. We applied a semantic segmentation technique to street-view images to estimate individual home- and mobility-based green exposure levels. Results: Results revealed that mobility-based green exposure significantly differs from home-based green exposure. Globally, wealthier individuals and non-minority groups experience significantly greater exposure to green space through both home- and mobility-based approaches compared to their counterparts. Locally, we found more nuanced pictures of green space inequalities when compared at the county level, suggesting locally varying relationships. Significance: This study suggests empirical evidence on how mobility-based measurements could help us assess inequality problems in exposure to urban green elements. Impact: Creating urban green corridors that comply with locally varying contexts can contribute to achieving equitable provision of green infrastructure for low-income and racially disadvantaged populations who have undesirable green exposure in their residential locations. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",2025,Social Science Research,127,,,10.1016/j.ssresearch.2025.103142,#868,Jang 2025,"Jang & Kim, 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,
Urban vegetation and income segregation in drylands: A synthesis of seven metropolitan regions in the southwestern United States,"Jenerette, G.D.; Miller, G.; Buyantuev, A.; Pataki, D.; Gillespie, T.W.; Pincetl, S.","To better understand how urbanization affects the amount and timing of urban vegetation in drylands we investigated remotely sensed vegetation patterns across seven large metropolitan regions in the southwestern United States. We asked (1) how low density urban land cover differed from adjacent wildland grass, herb, and shrub land covers in both the amount of vegetation and the length of the growing season, (2) how neighborhood income affected patterns of vegetation within low density urban cover, and (3) how cities differed from one another in their vegetation patterns. We found that urbanization generally has a strong influence on vegetation compared to adjacent wildlands. In four of the metropolitan regions the cumulative enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and growing season length in low density developments were higher than grass, herb, and shrub land covers. Within all metropolitan regions, there was a significant socioeconomic effect where higher income areas had a higher cumulative EVI than lower income areas. The large differences in urban vegetation among cities were related to precipitation and total domestic water use. These findings help to identify how urbanization influences vegetation, with implications for the availability of ecosystem services and requirements for irrigation in hot dryland cities. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2013,Environmental Research Letters,8,4,,10.1088/1748-9326/8/4/044001,#5269,Jenerette 2013,"Jenerette et al., 2013",,,,,,,,,,,,
Environmental equity and access to parks in Greater Montreal: an analysis of spatial proximity and potential congestion issues,"Jepson, V.; Apparicio, P.; Pham, T.-T.-H.","Past studies have shown that the distribution of parks is not always equitably distributed in urban areas, raising concerns about environmental equity and justice. Most of them have analyzed park access by using the closest walking network distance. However, access could also vary locally according to both supply (park area or facilities) and the potential demand (population surrounding the park) by using the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method. This study aims to verify the existence of environmental inequities for four population groups (children, seniors, low-income individuals, and visible minorities) according to park proximity and potential park congestion. To do so, three accessibility measures are calculated: closest park (shortest walking distance) and two gradient E2SFCA (hectares and facilities per inhabitants). We find higher potential park area and facility congestion in inner-city neighborhoods than in suburban municipalities. Generalized linear models and multinomial logistic regression analyses show no drastic degrees of inequity over Greater Montreal. However, visible minorities and low-income households are more prone to live closer to potentially highly congested parks both in terms of hectares and facilities. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2025,Journal of Urbanism,18,3,534-552,10.1080/17549175.2022.2150271,#1043,Jepson 2025,"Jepson et al., 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,
The racial/ ethnic distribution of heat risk-related land cover in relation to residential segregation,"Jesdale, B.M.; Morello-Frosch, R.; Cushing, L.","Objective: We examined the distribution of heat risk-related land cover (HRRLC) characteristics across racial/ ethnic groups and degrees of residential segregation. Methods: Block group-level tree canopy and impervious surface estimates were derived from the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset for densely populated urban areas of the United States and Puerto Rico, and linked to demographic characteristics from the 2000 Census. Racial/ groups in a given block group were considered to live in HRRLC if at least half their population experienced the absence of tree canopy and at least half of the ground was covered by impervious surface (roofs, driveways, sidewalks, roads). Residential segregation was characterized for metropolitan areas in the United States and Puerto Rico using the multigroup dissimilarity index. Results: After adjustment for ecoregion and precipitation, holding segregation level constant, non-Hispanic blacks were 52% more likely (95% CI: 37%, 69%), non-Hispanic Asians 32% more likely (95% CI: 18%, 47%), and Hispanics 21% more likely (95% CI: 8%, 35%) to live in HRRLC conditions compared with non-Hispanic whites. Within each racial/ ethnic group, HRRLC conditions increased with increasing degrees of metropolitan area-level segregation. Further adjustment for home ownership and poverty did not substantially alter these results, but adjustment for population density and metropolitan area population attenuated the segregation effects, suggesting a mediating or confounding role. Conclusions: Land cover was associated with segregation within each group, which may be explained partly by the concentration of minorities into densely populated neighborhoods within larger, more segregated cities. In anticipation of greater frequency and duration of extreme heat events, climate change adaptation strategies, such as planting trees in urban areas, should explicitly incorporate an environmental justice framework that addresses racial/ ethnic disparities in HRRLC.",2013,Environmental Health Perspectives,121,7,811-817,10.1289/ehp.1205919,#5226,Jesdale 2013,"Jesdale et al., 2013",,,,,,,,,,,,
Leveling the playing field? Urban disparities in funding for local parks and recreation in the Los Angeles region,"Joassart-Marcelli, P.","Access to parks and recreational facilities, as well as their quality, congestion, and affordability, relates to physical activity levels and, in turn, various health outcomes. Yet park and recreational resources are often insufficient and unevenly distributed within metropolitan regions. This paper documents and analyzes the allocation of federal, state, special district, munic-ipal, and nonprofit resources to parks and recreation facilities across municipalities within the Los Angeles region. Results indicate that local funding for parks and recreation resources is highly uneven (from less than $1 to over $500 per capita annually). Because most park and recreation spending originates at the local level, fiscally healthier cities allocate more resources to these uses. State and nonprofits funds tend to favor middle-income communities and fail to equalize spending. Inner-ring suburbs with large minority populations, and low-income exurban communities are most likely to suffer from low expenditure. Federal devolution, increased localization of service provision, and limited inter-governmental transfers have resulted in large intrametropolitan disparities in the distribution of resources for parks and recreation, ultimately shaping the landscape of health risks for local populations. © 2010 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.",2010,Environment and Planning A,42,5,1174-1192,10.1068/a42198,#5483,Joassart-Marcelli 2010,"Joassart-Marcelli, 2010",,,,,,,,,,,,
Disparities in physical activity resource availability in six US regions,"Jones, SA; Moore, LV; Moore, K; Zagorski, M; Brines, SJ; Roux, AVD; Evenson, KR","Objective. We conducted an ecological study to determine physical activity resource availability overall and by sociodemographic groups in parts of six states (CA, IL, MD, MN, NC, NY).Methods. Data on parks and recreational facilities were collected from 3 sources in 2009-2012. Three measures characterized park and recreational facility availability at the census tract level: presence of resource, number of resources, and >= 1 resource kernel density. Associations between resource availability and census tract characteristics (predominant racial/ethnic group, median income, and proportion of children and older adults) were estimated using linear, binomial, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression in 2014. Pooled and stratified analyses were conducted.Results. The study included 7139 census tracts, comprising 9.5% of the 2010 US population. Overall the availability of parks and recreational facilities was lower in predominantly minority relative to non-Hispanic white census tracts. Low-income census tracts and those with a higher proportion of children had an equal or greater availability of park resources but fewer recreational facilities. Stratification revealed substantial variation in resource availability by site.Conclusion. The availability of physical activity resources varied by sociodemographic characteristics and across regions. Improved knowledge of resource distribution can inform strategies to provide equitable access to parks and recreational facilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Legacies of redlining lead to unequal cooling effects of urban tree canopy,"Jung, M.C.; Yost, M.G.; Dannenberg, A.L.; Dyson, K.; Alberti, M.","Redlining—a racially discriminatory policy of systematic disinvestment established by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) in the 1930s and continued until the late 1960s—still influences the contemporary landscape of cities in the US. While the heterogeneous distribution of land surface temperature and tree canopy cover between neighborhoods with different HOLC grades have been recently examined, the development of long-term and city-specific heat management strategies is still limited. Here, we explored the effect of redlining in Portland, Oregon, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to assess its contemporary impact on climate equity. We performed a change analysis of land surface temperature and tree canopy area over the past and introduced mixed-effects models to test the intra- and inter-city differences in canopy cooling effects between the different HOLC grades. We found that (1) persistent temporal patterns of lower land surface temperatures and larger tree canopy areas are observed in higher HOLC grades, (2) greater green equity was achieved through contrasting temporal changes in tree canopy areas across HOLC grades in Portland and Philadelphia, and (3) opposite patterns exist between these cities, with stronger canopy cooling effects in neighborhoods with a Low HOLC grade in Portland and those with a High HOLC grade in Philadelphia. Differences in tree canopy change between the two cities over the past decade highlight potential influences of city-specific tree planting practices.

Investigating Socioeconomic Disparities in Park Access Across Two Southeastern US Cities Using a Unique Park Metric: An Ecological Analysis,"Kaczynski, A.T.; Wende, M.E.; Schipperijn, J.; Hughey, S.M.; Stowe, E.W.; Hipp, J.A.; Hesam Shariati, F.; Koohsari, M.J.","Purpose: This study aimed to demonstrate how ParkIndex values can be used to examine issues related to composite park access, and to investigate whether ParkIndex scores for block groups were significantly different by income, race/ethnicity, and population density. Design: Cross-sectional, environmental justice analysis of spatial disparities. Setting: Greenville County, South Carolina, and Raleigh, North Carolina. Subjects: Park access and quality data were collected for a total of 507 block groups across the study setting. Measures: For all study block groups, we empirically derived a multi-dimensional park access metric called ParkIndex representing the probability of park use based on three park availability and quality indicators. Block group median household income, race/ethnicity, and population density were obtained from the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Analysis: Choropleth maps were used to juxtapose ParkIndex values and neighborhood sociodemographic attributes. Analysis of variance was conducted to examine differences in ParkIndex values by multiple sociodemographic variables. Results: No significant differences in ParkIndex values were found by median household income (F = 0.15,P = .86), percent non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity (F = 0.22,P = .80), or population density (F = 0.70,P = .50). Conclusion: The current study contributes to the fast-growing body of literature examining whether access to quality parks is equitably distributed in diverse locations. Future research can investigate the utility and generalizability of this composite metric to identify and mitigate potential environmental injustices and health disparities. © The Author(s) 2025.

Methods: This study occurred in 2010-2011 in El Paso, Texas. All census tracts (n = 112) were categorized as low, medium, or high income and percent foreign-born. The number of parks intersecting each tract was determined using ArcGIS and park features (facilities, amenities) and characteristics (aesthetic features, park and neighborhood quality/safety concerns) were assessed via park audits (n = 144). Analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis tests examined differences across income and percent foreign-born tertiles for all park measures. Results: The medium income tertile had more parks than the high tertile, and more park facilities than the low or high tertiles, but no differences in park amenities were observed across income groups. As well, none of park availability, facilities, or amenities differed across percent foreign-born tertiles. Finally, parks in the high income tertile had significant fewer park and neighborhood quality/safety concerns and parks in the high percent foreign-born tertile had significantly greater park and neighborhood quality/safety concerns.

Green space access and visitation disparities in the phoenix metropolitan area,"Kim, Y.; Corley, E.A.; Won, Y.; Kim, J.","Previous green space equity studies have relied on access measures, such as the distance to, number of, or size of green spaces and have produced mixed results on green space disparities in the U.S. While the benefits of green spaces can be fulfilled when people visit them, attention to the differential use of green spaces has been less common. We examined green space inequalities using traditional access measures in order to understand which group has lower access to local parks and then investigated which urban residents visit local parks more using SafeGraph's mobility data. We found that the Phoenix metro area experiences green space access disparities by age group and (partially) income rather than by race and ethnicity. Access to local parks consistently decreased as the percentage of the elderly population increased in a neighborhood. However, the visit to local parks consistently increased as the percentage of children and the elderly increased.

Furthermore, there has been little research that visualized the spatially heterogeneous (in)equity of access to urban parks from an intersectional perspective on sociodemographic categories across communities. To address these research gaps, this study examined the spatially heterogeneous intersectionality of the socioeconomic categories of race and poverty (e.g., White poverty, African American poverty, and Asian poverty), in terms of access to urban parks across 784 census tracts in the Detroit Metropolitan Area. The findings showed that African American and Asian poverty groups had equitable access to urban parks.

Inequality in the Delivery of Urban Services: A Reconsideration of the Chicago Parks,"Koehler, D.H.; Wrightson, M.T.","The literature on urban services delivery supports the conclusion that the distribution of services is a function of bureaucratic norms and professionalism, and is largely impervious to political forces. A recent study (Mladenka, 1980) of the distribution of park facilities in Chicago showed essentially no relationship to city politics, in terms of race. Some feel that this study provides the evidence necessary to finalize the conclusion that the distribution of urban services is independent from political considerations. In this paper, we reexamine the Chicago Parks case study. First, it is shown that using a similar research design it is possible to replicate the 1980 findings. Next, it is shown that the results are equally attributable to exogenous variables which were not considered in the earlier study, and which have generally been overlooked in research on this subject. Finally, a regression model is estimated to test several competing explanations of urban services distribution. The results show that efficiency and politics are independently significant explanatory factors in the distribution of park facilities, while equity is not.

Uniting geospatial assessment of neighborhood urban tree canopy with plan and ordinance evaluation for environmental justice,"Kolosna, C.; Spurlock, D.","Trees are not evenly distributed across urbanized areas and there is evidence that Black, Hispanic, and low-income residents have lower proximal tree canopy coverage. The complex interplay between social policy and the built/physical environment contributes to these outcomes, but much of the research on environmental justice focuses on either producing evidence of inequity or assessing policy to determine its effect on the physical environment. This paper attempts to unite those two approaches by 1)measuring the urban tree canopy (UTC)at a scale that reflects local socio-political decision making and 2)assessing how the local policy documents regulating UTC acknowledge and attempt to remediate disparity. A maximum likelihood supervised classification of 1-m resolution imagery for a purposive sample of twelve historically racially segregated neighborhoods in two North Carolina cities estimated UTC at the block level. Using a spatial autoregressive model, we found a statistically significant negative association between UTC coverage, percentage of non-White population, the presence of nonresidential zoning, and percentage of parcel within the right-of-way. Content analysis found the municipal comprehensive plans and development management ordinances lack city-wide canopy coverage goals, do not utilize neighborhood geographies to target action and evaluation, and do not account for, or attempt to reduce, the potential inequitable distribution of urban trees. Existing policies could further contribute to disparate UTC outcomes by allowing neighborhoods to create their own UTC coverage standards and by crafting ordinances with variable standards for neighborhoods with non-residential zones. As a result, communities unable to counteract intensive zoning and/or advocate for enhanced tree canopy provisions are at a disadvantage in the remediation of UTC disparities.

This study confirms that the relationship between them in Atlanta is changing and the hypothesis of inequitable distribution of tree canopy concerning demographic attributes cannot be fully supported beyond 2000. In addition, the proportion of African Americans can have different effects on the estimated tree canopy as poverty rates vary. Planning to mitigate environmental inequities through tree plantings requires more careful analysis that goes beyond the socioeconomic/demographic attributes of the population. © The Author(s) 2019.",2023,Journal of Planning Education and Research,43,1,166-181,10.1177/0739456X19864149,#2564,Koo 2023,"Koo et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
Street trees and equity: Evaluating the spatial distribution of an urban amenity,"Landry, S.M.; Chakraborty, J.","While urban disamenities and pollution sources have received considerable attention in environmental justice research, few studies have examined sociospatial inequities associated with the distribution of desirable land uses. In this paper we focus on addressing this limitation by investigating the environmental equity implications of street trees - an important publicly financed amenity that provides several direct and indirect benefits to urban residents. The specific objective was to determine if the spatial distribution of public right-of-way trees is equitable with respect to race and ethnicity, income, and housing tenure in the city of Tampa, Florida, USA. We seek to extend research on equity analysis of urban amenities through several methodological innovations, including: (a) accounting for the heterogeneity of urban land use; (b) utilizing high-resolution remote sensing techniques to quantify parcel-specific tree cover; and (c) using multivariate regression models that control for spatial dependence within the data. The results support the inequity hypothesis by indicating a significantly lower proportion of tree cover on public right-of-way in neighborhoods containing a higher proportion of African-Americans, low-income residents, and renters. These findings have important implications for local public investment and policy strategies. © 2009 Pion Ltd.",2009,Environment and Planning A,41,11,2651-2670,10.1068/a41236,#5541,Landry 2009,"Landry & Chakraborty, 2009",,,,,,,,,,,,
Heat-moderating effects of bus stop shelters and tree shade on public transport ridership,"Lanza, K.; Durand, C.P.","Rising temperatures threaten the resilience of public transit systems. We determined whether bus stop shelters and tree canopy surrounding bus stops moderated the effect of warm season temperatures on ridership in Austin, Texas, and whether shelters and trees were equitably distributed. For bus stops (n = 2271) of Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority, boardings per bus were measured 1 April-30 September 2019. Air temperature data originated from the Camp Mabry weather station. Tree canopy was calculated by classification of high-resolution aerial imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program. Data on race, ethnicity, poverty level, median age, and bus commuters within census tracts of bus stops originated from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. Using multilevel negative binomial regression models, we found that shelters did not moderate the effect of high temperatures on ridership (p > 0.05). During high temperatures, each one-percent increase in tree canopy was associated with a lesser decrease (1.6%) in ridership compared to if there were no trees (1.7%) (p < 0.001). In general, shelters and trees were equitably distributed. Insignificant or modest effects of shelters and trees on ridership during high temperatures may be attributed to the transit dependency of riders. For climate change adaptation, we recommend tree planting at bus stops to protect from ridership losses and unhealthy exposure to extreme heat. © 2021 by the authors.

"How race, ethnicity, and income moderate the relationship between urban vegetation and physical activity in the United States","Lanza, K.; Stone, B.; Haardarfer, R.","To facilitate physical activity interventions, researchers identify which factors associate with physical activity, such as vegetation levels of the surrounding environment. While most studies examining vegetation and physical activity find a positive correlation, the literature does not investigate how vegetation may have a varied effect on physical activity based on demographic composition. This study examined how race, ethnicity, and income moderate the relationship between both non-tree vegetation and tree canopy on the percentage of individuals participating in leisure-time physical activity per census tract. Physical activity data from 2013 to 2014 for 7842 census tracts across 25 US cities originated from the CDC's 500 Cities project. Aerial images from the USDA's National Agriculture Imagery Program were used to classify vegetation levels per tract. Demographic variables originated from the American Community Survey 2011–2015 5-year estimates. Tracts were stratified into four types (Black + low income, Hispanic + low income, White + high income, and remaining) and assessed through multilevel modeling as to whether tract type moderated the relationship between vegetation and physical activity. Results showed that non-tree vegetation negatively associated with physical activity across all census tract types, while tree canopy exhibited a mixed association with physical activity, based on tract type. These findings can spur further research into how vegetation impacts physical activity of different demographic groups, and potentially inform greenspace and tree planting installments in those areas at greatest risk for physical inactivity-related diseases. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019,Preventive Medicine,121,,55-61,10.1016/j.ypmed.2019.01.022,#4345,Lanza 2019,"Lanza et al., 2019",,,,,,,,,,,,
Disparities in the provision of public parks in neighbourhoods with varied Latino composition in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area,"Lara, F.; Garcia, H.","This article examines the provision of public parks in Latino and non-Latino neighbourhoods in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. Though previous research has examined the socio-spatial distribution of urban parks, few have analysed both accessibility and variations in park features associated with the Latino composition of neighbourhoods. In this study, geographical information systems were employed to assess the availability and accessibility of neighbourhood parks, and Google Earth was used to audit their natural and built environmental features. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Games-Howell post hoc test was applied to examine the hypothesis that park resources are not equitably distributed across neighbourhoods, and that Latino places are disproportionally affected by a suboptimal provision of park space and services. The analysis points to invariance across neighbourhoods in terms of quantity and features of public parks, so the expected systemic pattern of inequality affecting Latino neighbourhoods in Phoenix Metro was not found. The study suggests, however, some areas wherein cities in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area could act to improve the allocation of public park resources and engage the diversity of local populations. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2018,Local Environment,23,12,1107-1120,10.1080/13549839.2018.1528443,#4633,Lara 2018,"Lara & Garcia, 2018",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Investigation of the Microenvironment, Land Cover Characteristics, and Social Vulnerability of Heat-Vulnerable Bus Stops in Knoxville, Tennessee","Lee, S.; First, J.M.","The urban heat island is a climate, public health, and environmental justice issue. Sustainable urban infrastructure needs improvements in public transport to protect citizens’ health from the urban heat island. This case study investigates the local microenvironment and social vulnerability of heat-vulnerable bus stops in Knoxville, Tennessee, using publicly available data from a variety of sources. These included ground and satellite measurements of heat and humidity from the Knoxville Heat Mapping Campaign, characteristics of land surface from the National Land Cover Dataset 2019 of the United States Geological Survey, and the 2018 Social Vulnerability Index from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A geographic information system and a principal component analysis were used to identify social vulnerability in areas where the bus stops are located. The results show that most heat-vulnerable bus stops are poor microenvironments without trees and shelters. The hottest bus stops are concentrated in the highly developed and densely populated areas of West Knoxville and downtown Knoxville and in South, North, Northeast, and Northwest Knoxville, which are relatively high vulnerability clustered and have poor public infrastructure.

How tree canopy cover can reduce urban suicide attempts: A geospatial analysis of the moderating role of area deprivation,"Lee, SM; Lee, RJ; Scherr, S","A lack of knowledge about the benefits of urban trees on mental health is addressed by exploring the association between tree canopy coverage, suicide attempts and the levels of neighborhood deprivation. Although the positive association between tree canopy cover and mental health as well as a negative association between neighborhood socioeconomic status and suicide attempts are well-known, it remains largely unclear how both area deprivation and tree canopy cover can help predicting local suicide attempts. Using the local suicide records (n = 3442) between 2015 and 2019 in the city of Cincinnati, OH, we analyzed if the number of local suicide attempts was related to the tree canopy cover at the census block group level (n = 275). After adjusting for control variables, we found that as the deprivation level gets a one-percentage point higher, the number of attempted suicide rate significantly increases by 1.05 %, while a one-percentage point increase in tree canopy coverage significantly decreases the attempted suicide rate by 0.9 %. Additionally, the level of area deprivation showed a moderating effect on the association between overall tree canopy and attempted suicide. Our findings suggest that local tree canopy cover could be a useful tool to improve local mental health including suicide attempts. More importantly, the benefit of tree canopy cover was stronger in less disadvantaged areas than in highly disadvantaged areas, which provides a new insight that interventions to qualitatively improve green space may be important for improving mental health in left-behind areas as a form of environmental justice.",2023,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,230,,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104606,#6632,Lee 2023,"Lee et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Who lives in greener neighborhoods? The distribution of street greenery and its association with residents' socioeconomic conditions in Hartford, Connecticut, USA","Li, X.; Zhang, C.; Li, W.; Kuzovkina, Y.A.; Weiner, D.","Street greenery plays an important role in enhancing the environmental quality of a city. Current urban environmental studies mainly focus on the distribution of desirable land uses (e.g., open spaces and parks). Few studies have been conducted on street greenery in residential areas, although it may provide a series of benefits to urban residents, such as energy saving, provision of shade, and aesthetic values. Google Street View (GSV) provides profile views of urban landscapes, and thus may be used for residential street greenery assessment. In this project, GSV was used in a case study to examine the relationships between the spatial distributions of residential street greenery and some socioeconomic variables in different block groups of Hartford, Connecticut, USA. The green view index was calculated based on the GSV images captured at different horizontal and vertical view angles to quantitatively represent how much greenery a pedestrian can see from ground level. Results showed that people with various social conditions have different amounts of street greenery in their living environments in Hartford.

Historical redlining and park use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from big mobility data,"Li, Y.; Huang, Y.; Li, R.; Zhang, K.","Background: Despite the health benefits of urban green space, disparities in its access and use have long existed. Emerging evidence suggests an adverse impact of redlining, a discriminatory practice decades ago, on multiple health outcomes. However, whether and to what degree redlining contributes to these disparities remains unknown particularly during a pandemic. With newly available mobility data tracking the locations of large numbers of mobile devices, this study links historical redlining with changes in green space use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This study examines how changes in park visits during the lockdown period (3/23/2020–8/2/2020) are associated with redlining across census tracts in three large U.S. cities. Methods: HOLC neighborhood redlining grade data were merged with SafeGraph mobility data at census tract level for New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Ordinary Least Square regressions were conducted to assess the association between dominant redlining grade and relative change in park visits in census tracts by comparing the lockdown period to the reference period. Spatial error and lag models were also used to account for potential spatial autocorrelation. Results: Park visits during the lockdown period in 2020 decreased by at least one-third in the three cities. The influence of redlining varied across neighborhoods and cities. In New York City, neighborhoods with more redlined areas experienced the largest drop, sharper decreases concentrated in neighborhoods previously graded as “best” or “still desirable” in Philadelphia, but the effect was barely present in Chicago. In addition, changes in park visits are positively correlated between neighborhoods in New York City and Chicago, but it’s not observed in Philadelphia. Impact Statement: Using emerging big mobility data, our study revealed large drops in park visits, a better measure than commonly-used access measures in capturing green space exposure, during the lockdown period. We found that historical redlining has a lasting impact on current green space use. More decreases in park visits were observed in the redlined areas in New York City, but patterns vary by neighborhood and city due to local-specific neighborhood dynamics. And changes in park visits were spatially, positively correlated across places. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc. 2023.",2024,Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology,34,3,399-406,10.1038/s41370-023-00569-3,#1805,Li 2024,"Li et al., 2024a",,,,,,,,,,,,
Analyzing spatial patterns of urban green infrastructure for urban cooling and social equity,"Li, L.; Kross, A.; Ziter, C.D.; Eicker, U.","‘Greening’ urban areas is a key strategy to counteract rising urban temperatures and their negative impacts on human health and well-being. Efficient green space management is needed for optimizing ecosystem benefits in urban areas with limited space availability. Existing research often overlooks the spatial configuration of urban green infrastructure (UGI) and focuses on single scales, limiting its application. Our study evaluates how the composition and configuration of UGI impacts the supply of cooling services at two spatial scales. We also assess the equity of access to these cooling services in Montreal, considering socioeconomic factors. Using a statistical model based on three key predictors, percent cover of both high and low vegetation and the largest patch index of high vegetation, we predict the cooling supply of UGI during summer daytime with a moderately high accuracy (R2 = 0.80). Our results showed that during the day, an increase of 10 % in the percent cover of high vegetation, percent cover of low vegetation, or largest patch index of high vegetation would lead to a decrease in average land surface temperature of 1.41 °C, 0.76 °C, or 0.20 °C, respectively. To assess social equity, we developed a cooling demand index based on the proportion of vulnerable groups, focusing on older adults and young children. Mapping mismatches in cooling supply and demand revealed that neighborhoods with higher proportions of visible minorities and low-income residents had significantly lower access to cooling services. Conversely, access was significantly positively correlated with income and post-secondary education levels. Overall, our results offer practical guidance for designing UGI layouts that maximize cooling supply and emphasize the need to prioritize underserved communities in urban greening efforts. © 2025 The Authors",2025,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,112,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2025.128983,#397,Li 2025,"Li et al., 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,
Examining the spatial distribution and temporal change of the green view index in New York City using Google Street View images and deep learning,"Li, X.","As an important part of the urban ecosystem, urban trees provide various benefits to urban residents. It is therefore important to examine the spatial distribution and the temporal change in urban tree canopies. Different from traditional overhead view remote sensing-based methods, street-level images, which present the most common view that people have of greenery, provide a more human-centric way to quantify street tree canopies. This study mapped and analyzed the spatial distribution and temporal change in the green view index, which represents the visibility of tree canopies along streets in New York City during the last 10 years using historical Google Street View images. Deep learning and computer vision algorithms were used to derive the quantitative information of street tree canopies from street-level images and map the spatial distribution of the green view index. This study further investigated the potential disparities in terms of green view index across different racial/ethnic groups by comparing with census data. Results show that non-Hispanic Whites tend to live in neighborhoods with higher green view index and Hispanics tend to live in neighborhoods with lower green view index. The green view index values in New York City have increased slightly in the last 10 years, and the change of green view index has no significant correlation with resident’s ethnic/racial status.

Environmental goods provision and gentrification: Evidence from MillionTreesNYC,"Li, LQ","Urban trees offer extensive environmental benefits. However, the distribution of trees in urban areas often disproportionately favors higher-income neighborhoods.

The results demonstrate that the additional urban street trees did serve as an environmental amenity, resulting in higher housing values and attracting more white, educated, and young households to areas with new trees. However, the gentrification effects of this tree-planting program were relatively small, with minimal change in community composition.

However, little is known about who has walking access to community gardens in most cities today and how this may change in the future. To address this gap, we examine 15-minute walking access to community gardens in New York City (NYC), and how land-use and investment decisions will impact the future of NYC as a 15-minute garden city. Our results indicate that more than half of the city's residents have this access to a community garden, and that neighborhoods with lower income, lower proportions of white residents and homeowners, and higher rates of educational attainment have better access. Optimization modeling indicates that universal 15-minute access is unlikely, though more than 70% of NYC residents could have walking access with as few as 50 additional community gardens. Supporting new community gardens on vacant land and parking lots is the most efficient way to expand access, though siting community gardens on a range of land use types is required to maximize access.

"Influence of urban-form and sociodemographic factors on street tree abundance transpire across scales in Houston, TX","Lin, W.; Guneralp, B.","Benefits provided by street trees can be enjoyed by all urban residents but trees along these public rights-of-way are usually unevenly distributed in a city. Both urban-form and sociodemographic factors can influence the spatial distribution of street trees. However, little is known how the relative importance of urban form and sociodemographic characteristics on street tree abundance inequalities vary across neighborhoods. In this study, we explored spatially varying influences of urban-form and sociodemographic variables on the distribution of street trees across Houston, Texas. We used three measures (green view index, street tree canopy, and street tree density) to measure street tree abundance. We then built multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) models to capture the spatial heterogeneity in the influence of urban form and sociodemographic factors on street tree abundance. Our analysis indicates that the effects of urban-form and sociodemographic determinants on street tree abundance disparities operate at varying spatial scales across Houston. Overall, ‘building coverage ratio’ and ‘percent residential land use’ play primary roles in shaping the distribution of street tree abundance in east Houston while effects of “percent renter occupied” and “median house value” are more pronounced in west Houston. Our results also show that urban-form and sociodemographic factors interact with each other at spatial scales ranging from a few neighborhoods to several districts to the entire city.

Are street tree inequalities growing or diminishing over time? The inequity remediation potential of the MillionTreesNYC initiative.,"Lin, J; Wang, Q","Most street tree inequality studies focus on examining tree abundance at single time point, while overlooking inequality dynamics measured based on a complete set of tree measures. Whether the severities of street tree inequalities vary with different tree structure measures, whether street tree inequalities are diminishing or growing over time, and how the inequality dynamics are affected by tree-planting programs remain largely unexplored. To fill these gaps, this study applied binned regression and cluster analyses to street tree census data of 1995-2015 in New York City. We investigated different structural measures of street tree inequalities pertaining to various aggregations of people, compared street tree inequalities over time, and revealed the inequity remediation role of the MillionTreesNYC initiative. We found that the underprivileged populations, characterized by higher percentages of the poor, racial minorities, young people, and less-educated people, are more likely to have lower tree abundance, less desired tree structure, poorer tree health condition, and more sidewalk damages. When disaggregating inequalities across various aggregations of people, income-based and education-based inequalities were the most severe, but the inequalities diminished over time. The race-based and age-based inequalities show mixed results that disfavor Hispanics, Blacks, and young people. The equity outcome of the MillionTreesNYC initiative is not ideal as the inequalities decrease when measured using tree count and species diversity, whereas they increase when measured using tree health and average diameter at breast height. The findings have important implications for more effective decision-making to balance resources between planting trees and protecting existing trees, and between increasing tree abundance and improving tree structure.",2021,J Environ Manage,285,,112207,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112207,#6208,Lin 2021,"Lin & Wang, 2021",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Socioeconomic and spatial inequalities of street tree abundance, species diversity, and size structure in New York City","Lin, J.; Wang, Q.; Li, X.","Street trees are often unequally distributed in urban areas, and their physical and structural attributes, such as extent of canopy cover, species composition, and size distribution, are also spatially heterogeneous. Some studies report that inequalities are more prevalent in streetscapes than in private landscapes. Considering the existing inequality issues and public nature of street trees, street tree inequality studies warrant greater attention. However, most existing studies in this field focus heavily on the unequal distribution of tree canopy cover, while disregarding other tree attributes. In this study, seven street tree measures covering tree abundance, species diversity, and size structure were derived from high-resolution satellite images, Google Street View, and street tree census. We then applied the geographically weighted regression to these seven tree measures in New York City, United States, compared street tree inequalities among different socioeconomic groups, and identified inequality hotspots. Our results show that street tree inequalities are greatest with respect to tree abundance and species diversity. Furthermore, race-based and education-based inequalities are most notable, and age-, income-, and household characteristic-based inequalities were also detected based on tree abundance or species diversity. Socially vulnerable areas that suffer the most severe inequalities are clustered in Brooklyn and Queens.

Socioeconomic disparities in cooling and warming efficiencies of urban vegetation and impervious surfaces,"Lin, J.; Zhang, H.; Chen, M.; Wang, Q.","Understanding the temperature regulation effects of urban vegetation and impervious surfaces, as well as how the effects interact with socioeconomic determinants of vulnerability to drive heat risk, is of critical importance for designing effective and equitable heat mitigation strategies. However, existing studies rarely compare temperature regulation efficiencies of diverse urban land cover types, nor do they examine whether distributions of urban vegetation and impervious surfaces could help reduce heat-related inequity by offering more cooling and less warming effects to marginalized communities. By employing satellite and socioeconomic data, this study quantified the cooling efficiencies of urban vegetation and warming efficiencies of impervious surfaces in 44 US cities, and then examined how these efficiencies change across neighborhoods of varying deprivation. We find that urban vegetation, especially trees, has strong cooling effects across different urban contexts, and the cooling efficiencies of urban trees and shrubs/grass are higher in neighborhoods of greater area deprivation. Conversely, buildings and roads produce the largest warming effects, and their warming efficiencies are either greater or at similar levels of magnitude in advantaged neighborhoods, when comparing with deprived neighborhoods. These findings suggest that strategically deploying green and built infrastructure could mitigate heat-related inequity in addition to improving health overall. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,Sustainable Cities and Society,92,,,10.1016/j.scs.2023.104464,#2490,Lin 2023,"Lin et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,

Adaptive Urban Heat Mitigation Through Ensemble Learning: Socio-Spatial Modeling and Intervention Analysis,"Ling, W.; Chu, L.","Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) are intensifying under climate change, exacerbating thermal exposure risks for socially vulnerable populations. While the role of urban environmental features in shaping UHI patterns is well recognized, their differential impacts on diverse social groups remain underexplored—limiting the development of equitable, context-sensitive mitigation strategies. To address this challenge, we employ an interpretable ensemble machine learning framework to quantify how vegetation, water proximity, and built form influence UHI exposure across social strata and simulate the outcomes of alternative urban interventions. Drawing on data from 1660Dissemination Areas in Vancouver, we model UHI across seasonal and diurnal contexts, integrating environmental variables with socio-demographic indicators to evaluate both thermal and equity outcomes. Our ensemble AutoML framework demonstrates strong predictive accuracy across these contexts (R2 up to 0.79), providing reliable estimates of UHI dynamics. Results reveal that increasing vegetation cover consistently delivers the strongest cooling benefits (up to 2.95 °C) while advancing social equity, though fairness improvements become consistent only when vegetation intensity exceeds 1.3 times the baseline level. Water-related features yield additional cooling of approximately 1.15–1.5 °C, whereas built-form interventions yield trade-offs between cooling efficacy and fairness.

Analysis of urban green space accessibility and distribution inequity in the City of Chicago,"Liu, D.; Kwan, M.-P.; Kan, Z.","Urban green space (UGS) has positive impacts on people's physical and mental health. Equal access to UGS for all people, regardless of their individual characteristics, is key to the achievement of better public health outcomes. Existing studies have focused largely on inequity in spatial UGS accessibility distribution but failed to uncover the disparities of UGS accessibility among different racial/ethnic and income groups as well as inequity in income-based UGS accessibility distribution within the same racial/ethnic groups. By using the city of Chicago as the study area, we adopt the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method to measure census tract-level UGS accessibility and compare distribution disparities among white-majority, black-majority and Hispanic-majority census tracts as well as low-income and non-low-income census tracts. In addition, we employ the Palma ratio to measure the income-based UGS accessibility distribution inequity within respective racial/ethnic groups. The results show that white-majority census tracts generally enjoy significantly better UGS accessibility than minority-dominated census tracts, while black-majority census tracts have higher UGS accessibility than Hispanic-majority census tracts. In terms of the intra-racial/ethnic income-based UGS accessibility inequity between the richest and the poorest, inequity is the lowest among white-majority census tracts and the highest among black-majority census tracts, with inequity in Hispanic-majority census tracts in the intermediate range. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH",2021,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,59,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127029,#3621,Liu 2021,"Liu et al., 2021",,,,,,,,,,,,
Assessment of Doubly Disadvantaged Neighborhoods by Healthy Living Environment Exposure,"Liu, D.; Kwan, M.-P.; Kan, Z.","Good access to greenspace and healthy food has commonly been found to be positively associated with health outcomes, despite some studies finding no significant relationship between them. Examining inequalities in accessing greenspace and healthy food among different disadvantaged neighborhoods can help reveal the disadvantaged races/ethnicities in cities with a high level of residential segregation (i.e., population of the same race/ethnicity concentrated in the same neighborhoods). However, existing studies have mostly focused on measuring the inequalities in accessing either greenspace or healthy food alone, which can lead to the inaccurate depiction of disadvantaged neighborhoods in healthy living environments. Therefore, this paper aims at improving the assessment of doubly disadvantaged neighborhoods by considering accessibility to both greenspace and healthy food in the City of Chicago. Our results show that black-majority neighborhoods are the most doubly disadvantaged in terms of exposure to healthy living environments. This study can help guide policymakers to divert more resources towards the improvement of the urban environment for the most doubly disadvantaged neighborhoods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2023,Applied Spatial Analysis and Policy,16,2,689-702,10.1007/s12061-022-09495-7,#2469,Liu 2023,"Liu et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
Urban greenery distribution and its link to social vulnerability,"Liu, Y.; Gu, X.; Wang, Z.; Anderson, A.","Urban greenery plays a pivotal role in urban environments, impacting the environmental well-being and people's comfort. Several studies have demonstrated a strong link between urban greenery and socioeconomic status but still lack an analysis of greenery on uneven distribution in social vulnerability. This study assesses how multi-level greenery rates distribute and associate the social vulnerability of people in 429 census tracts in the Seattle metropolitan area. It integrates multi-source urban informatics data, including remote sensing data and street view imagery, to identify various vegetation types. Then, it uses the interpretable machine learning model to explore the relationship between street-level green space distribution and community vulnerability. The results show a serious problem of uneven distribution of green spaces in urban centers since urban areas are built up and fragmented the landscape. Areas with low urban greening in the Seattle area have higher rates of poverty, unemployment, racial segregation, and housing overcrowding. Besides, greening features like street green views, which are more related to human perception, have a great association with social vulnerability. These findings contribute to the urban green spaces to better promote community equity and vulnerability. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH",2024,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,101,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128542,#1479,Liu 2024,"Liu et al., 2024",,,,,,,,,,,,

Not All Green Is Equal: Growth Form Is a Key Driver of Urban Vegetation Sensitivity to Climate in Chicago,"Love, N.L.R.; Berkelhammer, M.; Tovar, E.; Romy, S.; Wilson, M.D.; Nunez-Mir, G.C.","Urban green spaces are important nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change. While the distribution of green spaces within cities is well documented, few studies assess whether inequities in green space quantity (i.e., percent cover) are mirrored by inequities in green space quality (i.e., vegetation health or sensitivity to stressors). Green space quality is important to measure alongside green space quantity because vegetation that is healthier and less sensitive to stressors such as climatic fluctuations sustain critical ecosystem services through stressful environmental conditions, especially as the climate changes. We use a 40-year remote sensing dataset to examine the spatial patterns and underlying drivers of vegetation sensitivity to short-term (monthly) climate fluctuations in Chicago. Our results show that although vegetation cover was not equitably distributed between racially and ethnically segregated census tracts, socio-demographic composition was not a key driver of spatial variation in short-term vegetation sensitivity to climate. Instead, we found that vegetation growth form was a strong predictor of differences in vegetation sensitivity among communities. At the census tract level, higher herbaceous/shrub cover was associated with increased sensitivity to climate, while higher tree cover was associated with decreased sensitivity. These results suggest that urban green spaces comprising trees will be less sensitive (i.e., more resistant) to short-term climate fluctuations than those comprising predominately herbaceous or shrub cover. Our findings highlight that urban green space quality can vary spatially within cities; however, more work is needed to understand how the drivers of vegetation sensitivity vary among cities, especially those experiencing different climatic regimes. This work is key to planning and planting high-quality, climate change-resilient and equitable urban green spaces. © 2025 by the authors.",2025,Remote Sensing,17,17,,10.3390/rs17172919,#470,Love 2025,"Love et al., 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,
Turning a new leaf: Social and land use drivers of urban tree canopy change in the Chicago Metropolitan Area 2010–2017,"Lyall, J.D.; Darling, L.E.; Locke, D.H.; Hardiman, B.S.","Increasing the equitable distribution of tree canopy is a priority for many cities, and tree canopy change studies are needed to inform natural resource managers on how and for whom canopy is changing. This study examines relationships between tree canopy change, socioeconomic/demographic characteristics, and land use at the block group and county scales, in Cook County, Illinois from 2010 to 2017. At the block group level, spatial Random Forest Regression models the nonlinear relationships between six canopy metrics and socioeconomic, demographic, and land use predictors. We also tabulated canopy change across land use categories at the county scale. Tree canopy decreased by 11,634 ha—1.1 % of Cook County's land area. Residential and transit land use types experienced the highest canopy gains and losses. Block groups with higher proportions of residential land, higher median income, home ownership rates, and lower housing densities experienced more canopy gains and losses. High housing density areas possessed less canopy, but lost less proportionally. Vacant and natural land were associated with canopy growth and persistence respectively. Diverse modeling suggests net canopy change calculations mask the presence of canopy turnover and that there is a need for a unification of canopy tabulations in the field.

City parks and slow streets: A utility-based access and equity analysis,"Macfarlane, G.S.; Voulgaris, C.T.; Tapia, T.","During the spring and summer of 2020, cities across the world responded to the global COVID-19 pandemic by converting roadway facilities into open pedestrian spaces. These conversions improved access to public open space, but measuring the variation in that improvement among different populations requires clear definitions of access and methods for measuring it. In this study, we evaluate the change in a utility-based park accessibility measure resulting from street conversions in Alameda County, Califor-nia. Our utility-based accessibility measure is constructed from a park activity location choice model we estimate using mobile device data — supplied by StreetLight Data, Inc. — representing trips to parks in that county. The estimated model reveals heterogeneity in inferred affinity for park attributes among different sociodemographic groups. We find, for example, that neighborhoods with more lower-income residents and those with more residents of color show a greater preference for park proximity while neighborhoods with higher incomes and those with more white residents show a greater preference for park size and amenities. We then apply this model to examine the accessibility benefits resulting from COVID-19 street conversions to create a set of small park-like open spaces; we find that this policy has improved equity in that marginalized communities including Black, Hispanic, and low-income households receive a disproportionate share of the policy benefits, relative to the population distribution. © 2022 Gregory S.

"The relationships between an historic neighborhood classification grade and tree canopy and impervious surface in Washington, DC, USA","Maney, J.; Locke, D.H.","Urban tree canopy provides benefits, but is not equitably distributed across neighborhoods, which is an environmental distributive injustice. Trees take time to grow, so historic neighborhood conditions explain, in part, present-day conditions and the inequitable distribution of tree canopy and associated benefits. In 1934, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was created to help develop new housing and promote homeownership by insuring home loans, and consequently helped shape urban development. In 1937, the FHA ranked neighborhoods in Washington, DC, and the greater metropolitan area based on various neighborhood characteristics, including the racial composition of inhabitants, using the letters A through H. A-E areas were associated with white residents. From 1934–1962, nearly all (98 %) of the loans the FHA insured went to white borrowers. We asked if tree canopy cover (which provides benefits) and impervious surface cover (which is deleterious) is associated with the rank-order of the FHA's neighborhood letter grades. High-resolution, high-accuracy land cover data from the Chesapeake Conservancy and FHA grade data from the Mapping Segregation Washington, DC project were used to examine and test these relationships with non-parametric Kruskal Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank Sum statistical tests. The percentage of tree canopy cover was significantly greater in high-ranked areas than lower, and impervious surface cover was more abundant in lower-ranked areas. The significant relationships persisted in sensitivity analyses using more encompassing definitions of tree canopy cover and impervious surface. The findings suggest that today's inequitably distributed tree canopy cover is related to historic inequality. © 2025",2025,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,108,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2025.128836,#711,Maney 2025,"Maney & Locke, 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,
The complexities of measuring access to parks and physical activity sites in New York City: A quantitative and qualitative approach,"Maroko, A.R.; Maantay, J.A.; Sohler, N.L.; Grady, K.L.; Arno, P.S.","Background: Proximity to parks and physical activity sites has been linked to an increase in active behaviors, and positive impacts on health outcomes such as lower rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Since populations with a low socio-economic status as well as racial and ethnic minorities tend to experience worse health outcomes in the USA, access to parks and physical activity sites may be an environmental justice issue. Geographic Information systems were used to conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses of park accessibility in New York City, which included kernel density estimation, ordinary least squares (global) regression, geographically weighted (local) regression, and longitudinal case studies, consisting of field work and archival research. Accessibility was measured by both density of park acreage and density of physical activity sites. Independent variables included percent non-Hispanic black, percent Hispanic, percent below poverty, percent of adults without high school diploma, percent with limited English-speaking ability, and population density. Results: The ordinary least squares linear regression found weak relationships in both the park acreage density and the physical activity site density models (R<inf>a</inf>2 = .11 and .23, respectively; AIC = 7162 and 3529, respectively). Geographically weighted regression, however, suggested spatial non-stationarity in both models, indicating disparities in accessibility that vary over space with respect to magnitude and directionality of the relationships (AIC = 2014 and -1241, respectively). The qualitative analysis supported the findings of the local regression, confirming that although there is a geographically inequitable distribution of park space and physical activity sites, it is not globally predicted by race, ethnicity, or socio-economic status. Conclusion: The combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrated the complexity of the issues around racial and ethnic disparities in park access. They revealed trends that may not have been otherwise detectable, such as the spatially inconsistent relationship between physical activity site density and socio-demographics. In order to establish a more stable global model, a number of additional factors, variables, and methods might be used to quantify park accessibility, such as network analysis of proximity, perception of accessibility and usability, and additional park quality characteristics. Accurate measurement of park accessibility can therefore be important in showing the links between opportunities for active behavior and beneficial health outcomes. © 2009 Maroko et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2009,International Journal of Health Geographics,8,1,,10.1186/1476-072X-8-34,#5555,Maroko 2009,"Maroko et al., 2009",,,,,,,,,,,,
Do Trees in Halifax Grow on Money?: A Comparison of Urban Tree Canopy Cover and Median Household Income in North End and South End Halifax,"Marshman, KA","Trees in the city provide numerous ecological, health, and social benefits to urban residents. Studies from large North American cities have confirmed a spatial pattern that higher urban forest tree canopy positively correlates with higher levels of affluence. The just distribution of trees will become increasingly important for urban planners and foresters as there is a national trend towards living in cities. This research report investigates the equity of distribution of urban tree canopy cover in two neighbourhoods on the peninsula of Halifax, Nova Scotia. High spatial resolution land cover data from 2007 and 2006 Statistics Canada census data was used to create maps and tables to answer the research question of whether or not canopy cover differs significantly in two neighbourhoods with varying socio-economic status. The socio-economic indicator of median household income is represented based on census tract dissemination areas from the 2006 Statistics Canada long survey. Preliminary results indicate lower median household income in the chosen study area of North End Halifax compared to higher median household income in the chosen study area of South End Halifax. Tree canopy cover density is slightly lower in North End Halifax (5.3%) than in South End Halifax (7.6%). These preliminary results coincide with findings of other researchers that higher household income at the neighbourhood level may result in increased urban forest canopy. However, further research and more reliant tree canopy cover data is needed to determine the accuracy of these findings.",2018,DALHOUSIE JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY MANAGEMENT,14,,,,#6579,Marshman 2018,"Marshman, 2018",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we use National Agriculture Imagery Program digital ortho photographs to survey the tree cover inequality for Census blocks in US large urbanized areas, home to 167 million people across 5,723 municipalities and other Census-designated places. We compared tree cover to summer land surface temperature, as measured using Landsat imagery. In 92% of the urbanized areas surveyed, low-income blocks have less tree cover than high-income blocks. On average, low-income blocks have 15.2% less tree cover and are 1.5 degrees C hotter than high-income blocks. The greatest difference between low- and high-income blocks was found in urbanized areas in the Northeast of the United States, where low-income blocks in some urbanized areas have 30% less tree cover and are 4.0 degrees C hotter. Even after controlling for population density and built-up intensity, the positive association between income and tree cover is significant, as is the positive association between proportion non-Hispanic white and tree cover. We estimate, after controlling for population density, that low-income blocks have 62 million fewer trees than high-income blocks, equal to a compensatory value of $56 billion ($1,349/person).

"A Spatial Analysis of Urban Tree Canopy Using High-Resolution Land Cover Data for Chattanooga, Tennessee","Mix, C.; Hunt, N.; Stuart, W.; Hossain, A.K.M.A.; Bishop, B.W.","Urban tree canopy (UTC) provides urban residents with numerous benefits, including positive mental and physical health, the mitigation and prevention of urban heat islands, and a sense of place. Numerous studies have shown that as the wealth of a community decreases, so does the amount of UTC found in the community; thus, wealthier communities are more likely to enjoy the benefits that urban forests provide. Emerging technologies in remote sensing and GIS are allowing for new opportunities to study and understand the relationships between urban neighborhoods and UTC. In this study, land cover data for Chattanooga, Tennessee were derived from high-resolution (50 cm) multispectral imagery to assess the previously unknown extent and distribution of UTC and to measure the extent of UTC by neighborhood and census block group level. Using exploratory regression analysis, variables representing income, population density, race, educational attainment, and urban heat islands were analyzed to investigate the influence of UTC on neighborhood characteristics. This study found that UTC represented half of the total land cover composition, the tree equity was not as profound as shown in other cities, and the lack of UTC likely influences the prevalence of urban heat islands.

Not Just a Walk in the Park: Methodological Improvements for Determining Environmental Justice Implications of Park Access in New York City for the Promotion of Physical Activity.,"Miyake, KK; Maroko AR; Grady KL; Maantay JA; Arno PS","The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that access to parks in New York City is not equitable across racial and ethnic categories. It builds on previous research that has linked access to parks and open space with increased physical activity, which in turn may reduce the risk for adverse health outcomes related to obesity. Systematic patterns of uneven access to parks might help to explain disparities in these health outcomes across sociodemographic populations that are not fully explained by individual-level risk factors and health behaviors, and therefore access to parks becomes an environmental justice issue. This study is designed to shed light on the ""unpatterned inequities"" of park distributions identified in previous studies of New York City park access. It uses a combination of network analysis and a cadastral-based expert dasymetric system (CEDS) to estimate the racial/ethnic composition of populations within a reasonable walking distance of 400m from parks. The distance to the closest park, number of parks within walking distance, amount of accessible park space, and number of physical activity sites are then evaluated across racial/ethnic categories, and are compared to the citywide populations using odds ratios. The odds ratios revealed patterns that at first glance appear to contradict the notion of distributional inequities.

Mean densities of tract resources were modeled by SES and racial composition using linear regression.Results: Minority neighborhoods were significantly more likely than white neighborhoods not to have recreational facilities (relative probability [RP] =3.27 [95% CI=2.11-5.07] and 8.60 [95% CI=4.48-16.511, for black and Hispanic neighborhoods, respectively). Low-income neighborhoods were 4.5 times more likely to not have facilities than high-income areas (95% CI=2.87-7.12). Parks were more equitably distributed. Most resources located in recreational facilities required a fee and were less dense in minority and low-income areas. Those located inside parks were usually free to use, sports-related, and denser in poor and minority neighborhoods.Conclusions: Recreational facilities and the resources they offer are not equitably distributed. The presence of parks in poor and minority areas suggest that improving the types and quality of resources in parks could be an important strategy to increase physical activity and reduce racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities.",2008,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE,34,1,16-22,10.1016/j.amepre.2007.09.021,#8217,Moore 2008,"Moore et al., 2008",,,,,,,,,,,,
Perceived and geographic access to urban green spaces in New York City during COVID-19.,"Mustafa, Ahmed; Kennedy, Christopher; Lopez, Bianca; McPhearson, Timon","In New York City (NYC), the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 induced a significant shift in the use and accessibility of urban green spaces (UGS). To understand the impact of COVID-19 on the access to UGS, we conducted a spatial analysis of geographic access to UGS and perceived access based on data collected from a social survey deployed from May 13 to June 15, 2020. We examine geographical accessibility to UGS and how this compares to perceived accessibility, or the ease which residents feel they can access a UGS. We further explored the correlation between spatial access to UGS and fifteen social vulnerability variables including economic status, household composition, minority status, and housing type for different zip codes. The results show that geographical proximity variables can predict a number of the perceived access variables, particularly those related to COVID-19 measures. Although lower-income communities were found to have higher spatial access to UGS, many of the same communities, including people living in crowded and multi-unit buildings, on average only have access to smaller green spaces, suggesting an uneven distribution of larger quality parks. This observation is further confirmed by survey results. These findings have implications for policies surrounding the distribution of UGS and whether equitable access is provided to NYC residents, with implications for similar patterns that may exist in other cities. • We compare geographical access to urban green spaces (UGS) with perceived access. • Geographical accessibility can predict perceived concerns regarding social distancing. • UGS environmental justice implications are related to perceptions of UGS qualities. • We overlap COVID-19 vulnerabilities with the availability of UGS at the zip code level. • Many working-class neighborhoods are highly impacted by COVID-19 and have smaller UGS.",2023,Cities,143,,N.PAG-N.PAG,10.1016/j.cities.2023.104572,#11949,Mustafa 2023,"Mustafa et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
"The equity of tree distribution in the most ruthlessly hot city in the United States: Phoenix, Arizona","Nelson, J.R.; Grubesic, T.H.; Miller, J.A.; Chamberlain, A.W.","Trees are critical assets in the urban environment. From reducing pollution and the effects of urban heat islands, decreasing energy consumption, and improving the overall quality of life for individuals and communities, trees are vital environmental amenities that promote and enhance public health, facilitating a more sustainable urban footprint. While many cities are making concerted efforts to plant more trees, empirical work suggests that the distribution of trees within these communities is unequal, fueled by a constellation of factors that include cost, maintenance, culture, and value systems. In order to identify and mitigate the inequities associated with the geographic distribution of trees within a community, it is important to deepen our understanding of the social, environmental, operational, and geographic nuances of tree distribution(s). In this study, we employ geocomputational and spatial statistical methods to analyze a database of 2.7 million trees in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area.

"Exploring relationships between socioeconomic background and Urban greenery in Portland, OR","Nesbitt, L.; Meitner, M.J.","Do urban residents experience societal benefits derived from urban forests equitably? We conducted a broad-scale spatial analysis of the relationship between urban greenery and socioeconomic factors in the Portland metropolitan area. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was derived from National Agriculture Imagery Program images to map urban vegetation cover, and Outdoor Recreation and Conservation Area data were used to identify green spaces. These measures of urban greenery were correlated with census data to identify socioeconomic factors associated with high levels of green inequity. Population density, house age, income, and race were strongly correlated with vegetation cover. However, the distribution of green spaces showed a much weaker relationship with socioeconomic factors. These results highlight the importance of different measures of access to urban greenery and suggest potential solutions to the problem of urban green inequity.

"The equity of urban forest ecosystem services and benefits in the Bronx, NY","Nyelele, C.; Kroll, C.N.","Trees provide important ecosystem services and benefits, with some, such as air pollutant and heat reductions, being linked to improved human health and well-being. The uneven distribution of tree cover in urban areas and subsequently the ecosystem services and benefits it provides has potential implications related to environmental justice, especially if disadvantaged socio-demographic or socio-economic and marginalized communities lack these services and benefits. This study explores the distribution of ecosystem services and benefits provided by tree cover in the Bronx, NY. Utilizing census block group specific spatial datasets, we employ a Mann-Kendall trend test and the Sen slope estimator to describe the relationship between median income, per capita income, percent minorities, population density, poverty percent and total educational attainment, and carbon storage and sequestration, stormwater runoff reduction, air pollutant removal and heat index reduction ecosystem services and benefits for 2010 tree cover conditions. We explore the equality in ecosystem service and benefit distributions across socio-demographic and socio-economic subgroups using the Atkinson inequality and Theil entropy indices decomposed into within and between subgroup inequalities for each ecosystem service and benefit. These inequality indices allow us to better assess current inequalities and work to achieve greater equity in the distribution of ecosystem services. Using population and ecosystem service data, all ecosystem services and benefits appear to be unequally and inequitably distributed in the Bronx, with disadvantaged socio-demographic and socio-economic block groups receiving disproportionately lower ecosystem services from urban trees. The vast majority of the inequality is explained by variations within each socio-demographic and socio-economic subgroup rather than variations between subgroups. To reduce this inequity, efforts should be made to strategically increase services and benefits by initially targeting disadvantaged block groups with extremely low tree cover. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH",2020,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,53,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126723,#3949,Nyelele 2020,"Nyelele & Kroll, 2020",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Understanding disparities in community green accessibility under alternative green measures: A metropolitan-wide analysis of Columbus, Ohio, and Atlanta, Georgia","Park, Y.; Guldmann, J.-M.","This study examines whether the level of community accessibility to green spaces varies as a function of socioeconomic factors, focusing on three underexplored aspects affecting green inequity assessment: implications of alternative green measures, spatial non-stationarity of socioeconomic impacts, and regional/local context. Using six green measures involving general greenness, tree canopy, developed open space, agricultural lands, parks, green trails, golf courses and sports fields, Geographically Weighted Regression models are developed, and coefficient surfaces are created and compared over two metropolitan areas, Columbus and Atlanta. Second-order effects among individual factors are tested to explore synergistic linkages among them. The results show that the identified patterns of green access inequity vary significantly with the selected green measure. In both metropolitan areas, access to parks, green trails, golf and sports fields turns out to be spatially independent from general greenness and tree canopies. GWR coefficient surfaces show that the socioeconomic-green relationships are spatially heterogeneous and context-dependent, affected by a complex web of forces, including urban heritage, racial and lifestyle diversity, and natural landscape. While natural landscape and income have greater effects in Columbus, racial disparity is dominant in Atlanta. Income-driven disparities are most visible in inner suburban areas and tend to abate in the urban core and exurbs.

Socially vulnerable people and stormwater infrastructure: A geospatial exploration of the equitable distribution of gray and green infrastructure in Washington D.C.,"Park, M.; Alves, P.B.R.; Whiteheart, R.M.; Hendricks, M.D.","Green Infrastructure (GI) has gained recognition for its notable role in climate change mitigation and urban resilience. Meanwhile, there is a growing body of literature revealing the uneven distribution of GI from environmental justice perspective. Given the role of GI, the distribution should also be explored in a social vulnerability context and combining green and gray infrastructure. However, the distribution of GI, sewer pipelines, and their relationship with social vulnerability remain underexplored. This study fills this gap by assessing stormwater infrastructure in Washington, D.C., against a backdrop of historical discriminatory sewage practices. It investigates whether disparities exist in the distribution of sewer pipelines and green infrastructure among communities with differing social vulnerabilities, using a comprehensive approach that encompasses GI, underground pipelines, and social vulnerability. The analysis reveals significant insights into the relationships between stormwater infrastructure, social vulnerability, and urbanization, offering valuable implications for stormwater management planning.

Persistent Social Vulnerability in Washington D.C. Communities and Green Infrastructure Clustering,"Park, M.","Cities worldwide are presently contending with the intricate task of formulating urban infrastructure that seamlessly blends sustainability and resilience to effectively tackle urgent challenges. An increasingly prominent strategy gaining swift traction is the deployment of green infrastructure (GI), heralding a multitude of advantages for the urban milieu. As a growing body of research highlights the emergence of a new equity issue in our infrastructures from the perspective of environmental justice, it becomes evident that there is a significant gap in comprehensive studies investigating the combined temporal and spatial evolution of green infrastructure (GI) distribution. This research aims to address this gap by adopting a novel approach that explicitly considers the temporal dimension of GI distribution. Unlike previous studies that often rely on cross-sectional snapshots, this study employs a panel data analysis, which allows for a comprehensive examination of how GI distribution evolves over time. The primary research question addressed in this study is whether GI distribution in Washington D.C. exhibits a propensity to concentrate within certain communities. This inquiry delves into the pressing concern of the potential exacerbation of existing disparities through GI implementation. The study’s findings may drive evidence-based policy recommendations that foster equitable distribution strategies, guaranteeing that socially vulnerable communities reap the rewards of GI’s positive impacts. © 2023 by the author.",2023,Land,12,10,,10.3390/land12101868,#2289,Park 2023,"Park, 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
Environmental Health Burdens and Socioeconomic Status in Rhode Island: Using Geographic Information Systems to Examine Health Disparities in Medical School.,"Pascual, KJ; Palosaari, A; Ochoa J; Dreyer C","Race and class are major predictors of health outcomes in the United States. Health disparities among racial and low-income minorities often have environmental etiologies. Using Rhode Island as a case study, we geocoded and visualized several environmental determinants of health via Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the entire state and conducted a geospatial analysis to determine whether or not patterns existed along racial and class lines. The variables that we geocoded include elementary schools, fast food restaurants, Superfund sites, and community parks. From a census tract level, we then analyzed the racial and income makeup of each geocoded site. We discovered that, on average, the worst-performing elementary schools, fast food restaurants, and Superfund sites in Rhode Island were clustered in neighborhoods with a larger black population and lower household income. Conversely, community parks and the best elementary schools in Rhode Island tended to be located near neighborhoods with a larger White population and higher household income. Our results provide additional evidence for the pervasiveness of the unequal distribution of environmental health burdens between low-income, minority communities and affluent, predominantly White communities. This summer experiential student project demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating GIS as a practical tool for learning health disparities material at a U.S. medical school. Our study also highlights the value of digital technology and citizen science in helping the public recognize and understand the various environmental factors that perpetuate health disparities.",2020,Cureus,12,8,e9816,10.7759/cureus.9816,#6030,Pascual 2020,"Pascual et al., 2020",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Locating the green space paradox: A study of gentrification and public green space accessibility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Pearsall, H; Eller, JK","This study examined gentrification patterns associated with eighteen new public green spaces created across Philadelphia, Pennsylvania around 2010. Our study had three primary goals: 1) Characterize the local relationships between green space creation and gentrification across the city; 2) Investigate how different models of ownership and management approaches impact the public accessibility of newly created green spaces, 3) Examine connections between the public accessibility of new parks and the gentrification of the neighborhood. We drew on data from the 2000 US Census and the 2011-2016 American Community Survey Estimate data at the Block Group level, a field survey on public accessibility for parks that explores ownership, management, use/users, and quality, and semi-structured interviews conducted with six key informants from July-October 2018. We used Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) to examine local patterns of gentrification and qualitative analysis to examine the public accessibility of the public green spaces and experiences of residents and community leaders during the park development process. We found that public green spaces may anchor gentrification processes. Additionally, new spaces in wealthy neighborhoods were more publicly accessible than parks in gentrifying neighborhoods. Many spaces located in gentrifying neighborhoods relied on private management and had surveillance strategies, including cameras to security personnel.

Mapping the greenscape and environmental equity in montreal: An application of remote sensing and GIS,"Pham, T.-T.-H.; Apparicio, P.; Sa©guin, A.-M.; Gagnon, M.","Vegetation and green spaces provide multiple benefits for urban life but they are not always evenly distributed throughout cities. Recent studies have shown that deprived and ethnic populations have less access to vegetation, which is a form of environmental inequity. The goal of this study is to map the vegetation cover and to spatially depict the problematic areas in terms of environmental inequity in Montreal. We carry out an object-oriented classification in eCognition from Quickbird images (at a resolution of 60cm) to identify two categories of vegetation: trees/shrub and grass. We then compute 12 vegetation indicators representing the proportion of vegetation, trees/shrub and grass in streets, alleys and residential yards. Finally, statistical analyses are undertaken to reveal the link between the vegetation indicators and the proportion of immigrants, visible minorities and low income individuals. Our results show that the proportion of vegetation varies significantly across the boroughs. About 30% of the areas exhibiting an elevated proportion of the three groups are identified as very high inequity whereas 10 to 14% are identified as areas with high green benefits. Environmental inequity with respect to the three populations also expresses differently depending on the type of green spaces (street and alleys for immigrants and visible minorities while all the three types of green spaces for the low income population).

Spatial distribution of vegetation in Montreal: An uneven distribution or environmental inequity?,"Pham, T.-T.-H.; Apparicio, P.; Sa©guin, A.-M.; Landry, S.M.; Gagnon, M.","Growing evidence is showing that across North American cities, underprivileged populations and racial and/or visible groups have disproportionally less access to vegetation than affluent groups, raising concerns of environmental inequity. This study aims to verify whether in Montreal (Canada) there is environmental inequity resulting from variations in urban vegetation for low-income people and visible minorities. More specifically, various vegetation indicators were extracted from very-high-resolution satellite images, including the proportion of city blocks, streets, alleys and backyards covered by total vegetation and trees/shrubs. Socio-demographic variables were obtained from 2006 Canada Census and rescaled to the city block level, by using a population-based weighing method. Statistical analysis indicates that there are disparities in the distribution of vegetation in Montreal which disfavour low-income people and, to a lesser extent, visible minorities. Disparities are also more pronounced on public land (streets, alleys) than on private land (backyards). Income is a major factor but cannot fully explain inequities among visible minorities. Notwithstanding the weak extent of such disparities, those vulnerable communities might need a better access to ecological services provided by vegetation, notably such as heat island mitigation.

Modeling results show that greenspace accessibility is a concern in both cities, with Jersey City experiencing more prominent disparities. We observed significant positive relationships in Camden between greenspace accessibility and two EJ variables: Black segregation and Hispanic segregation. Most streets in both cities have poor greenness exposure, although Jersey City faces higher inequality compared to Camden.

"What can a midsized, semi-arid city teach us about human-made forests?","Rasmussen, S.M.; Tinkham, W.T.; McHale, M.R.","Research has shown that urban tree canopy (UTC) provides a multitude of ecosystem services to people in cities, yet the benefits and costs of trees are not always equitably distributed among residents and households. To support urban forest managers and sustainability planning, many studies have analyzed the relationships between UTC and various morphological and social variables. Most of these studies, however, focus on large cities like Baltimore, MD, Los Angeles, CA, and New York, NY. Yet, small and midsized cities are experiencing the most growth globally, often having more opportunity to alter management strategies and policies to conserve and/or increase canopy cover and other green infrastructure. Using both a linear and spatial regression approach, we analyzed the main drivers of UTC across census block groups in Fort Collins, CO, a midsize, semi-arid city projected to undergo significant population growth in the next 20-30 years. Results from Fort Collins indicated that block groups with older buildings and greater housing density contained more UTC, with 2.2% more canopy cover for every 10 years of building age and 4.1% more for every 10 houses per hectare. We also found that distributional inequities may already be developing within this midsized city, as block groups with more minority communities were associated with lower UTC. We compared the drivers of UTC in Fort Collins to other cities located in different climate regions, or biomes, and in various stages of urban development.

This study aims to examine the relationship between green space density and flood vulnerability in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area by integrating social and geophysical data. The research focuses on identifying areas where high flood vulnerability coincides with low green space availability, as these are critical regions for targeted intervention. Using social vulnerability indicators such as income, age, and housing characteristics, combined with geophysical factors like soil permeability and drainage density, the study assesses flood vulnerability across census block groups. Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) and discriminant analysis were employed to detect spatial clusters with elevated flood risks and low green space density. Results reveal that these high-risk clusters are concentrated in densely urbanised areas such as Norristown, where lower-income and elderly populations are overrepresented. These findings reinforce broader environmental justice concerns, as socially vulnerable communities face compounded risks from both inadequate flood protection and limited access to green spaces.

Inequities in the quality of urban park systems: An environmental justice investigation of cities in the United States,"Rigolon, A.; Browning, M.; Jennings, V.","A growing body of research shows affluent White neighborhoods have more acres of parks and more park facilities than low-income ethnic minority communities in many Global North cities. Most of these investigations focused on neighborhood-level differences and did not analyze broader inequities across cities. This is a particularly significant limitation in the U.S., where changes in the political economy of parks due to a reduced local tax base have led cities to compete against each other to secure park funding from national nonprofits and public agencies. To address this gap, we examined whether the quality of urban park systems – measured through The Trust for Public Land's ParkScore – varies depending on a city's median income and ethnic composition. Based on multivariate regressions in which we control for features of the urban fabric, we found U.S. cities with higher median incomes and lower percentages of Latino and Non-Hispanic Black residents have higher ParkScores than other cities. Some inequities also emerged for park coverage, park spending per person, and park facilities, with majority-Latino cities being particularly disadvantaged. These findings echo the results of neighborhood-level studies in Global North contexts, suggesting neighborhood-level inequities in park provision might scale up to inequities across cities. This study contributes to environmental justice theory and advocacy by demonstrating the importance of scaling up analyses of park provision to cross-city comparisons.

"Parks and young people: An environmental justice study of park proximity, acreage, and quality in Denver, Colorado","Rigolon, A.","Young people − including children and teenagers − are spending less time playing outside in nature than previous generations. This decrease is problematic, as parks can provide young people with physical and mental health benefits. Also, growing health disparities exist between white and ethnic minority young people in the U.S. These concerns motivate an investigation into access to parks for young people of different ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Although several recent studies have focused on park quality, no previous inquiry has employed a youth-centered framework to measure access, nor has used an index of park quality describing young people's park needs. To address these gaps, I investigated access to parks in Denver, Colorado through a comprehensive geospatial approach − including park proximity, acreage, and quality − that models park and walkability features supporting frequent park use for children and teenagers. My findings show a multifaceted pattern of environmental injustice. Ethnic minority and low-income people have better access than other groups in terms of park proximity. High-income and white people, however, have access to significantly more acres of parks per youth, to more parks with excellent levels of quality, and to safer parks than other groups. The dramatic disparities in park safety might strongly limit park use among Denver's low-income young people of color. This analytical framework can help park planners identify specific gaps in park provision for youth and develop strategies to address quality and acreage disparities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2017,Landscape and Urban Planning,165,,73-83,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.05.007,#4697,Rigolon 2017,"Rigolon, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Using the 3-30-300 Indicator to Evaluate Green Space Accessibility and Inequalities: A Case Study of Montreal, Canada","Robitaille, E.; Douyon, C.","Access to green spaces is essential for promoting public health, reducing inequalities, and fostering urban resilience. This study evaluates the 3-30-300 indicator as a tool for assessing green space accessibility in Montreal, Canada. The framework sets three goals: every resident should see three trees from their home, live in a neighborhood with at least 30% tree canopy, and have a park or green space within 300 m. Using geospatial analysis, this study examines how well these criteria are met across Montreal’s neighborhoods and investigates disparities linked to socio-economic factors. The study reveals a significant variability in the distribution of green spaces across Montreal neighborhoods, as measured by the 3-30-300 metric. Tree canopy coverage ranges from 0.8% to 84%, with a median of 25.7%, while distances to parks vary from adjacent to over 2.4 km. The number of trees around residences is highly skewed, ranging from 0 to 771, reflecting substantial heterogeneity in green space accessibility. Spatial analysis highlights pronounced inequalities, with only 19.4% of neighborhoods meeting all three criteria. Hotspots of compliance are concentrated in peri-central and well-established residential areas in the West and East, while central and peripheral neighborhoods, especially in northeast Montreal, frequently fail to meet the standards. These findings underscore strong spatial disparities in urban green infrastructure, consistent with global studies on inequitable access to green spaces. © 2025 by the authors.",2025,Geographies,5,1,,10.3390/geographies5010006,#885,Robitaille 2025,"Robitaille & Douyon, 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,
The role of conserved and managed land in ecosystem service inequity,"Rodriguez Gonzalez, M.I.; Pijanowski, B.C.; Fahey, R.T.; Hardiman, B.S.","Integrating ecosystem services (ESs), i.e., the benefits humans obtain from nature, into decision making is essential for the sustainable management of resilient urban landscapes, where people and nature are interdependent. However, ES spatial assessments often leave unanswered important questions about their relationship to social systems and their implications in management. In this study, we identified ES provisioning areas in the Chicago metropolitan region that have potential to produce ESs across multiple ES-categories (i.e., ES hotspots). We also identified areas lacking this capacity (i.e., ES coldspots). We then analyzed spatial linkages to local demographics. Specifically, we: (1) modelled the distribution of ES hotspots and ES coldspots at 30-m resolution; (2) compared the proportion of total ES-hotspot and ES-coldspot land area to that of racial groups and residents living below the poverty line; and (3) determined overlap of ES hotspots and ES coldspots with conservation, managed and public open land. We found that, at regional level, ES-hotspots correlate negatively with racial minorities. We also observed that a great number of ES hotspots overlap with conserved and government-managed land, but because these land types inversely correlate with racial minorities it is likely that these cannot serve to alleviate race-based ES inequality if targeted. Therefore, we made a number of suggestions on how to circumvent this issue, including acquiring land (for conservation) in areas where racial minorities live the most, particularly targeting vacant lots and grassland within the City of Chicago to address ES inequity in the region. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,Landscape and Urban Planning,227,,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104516,#2895,Rodriguez Gonzalez 2022,"Rodriguez Gonzalez et al., 2022",,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, a correlation between aviation-related noise pollution and low tree canopy cover suggests a potential avenue for utilizing nature as a buffer against heightened noise levels. However, recognizing the delicate equilibrium between fostering a thriving tree canopy and ensuring aviation safety highlights a need for innovative urban planning solutions capable of simultaneously addressing sonic injustice and tree inequity. © © 2023 GJGP-Undip.",2023,Geoplanning,10,2,179-184,10.14710/geoplanning.10.2.179-184,#2637,Rodriguez-Gonzalez 2023,"Rodriguez-Gonzalez & Torres-Garrido, 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Equity, travel, and park visitation in 10 US metro areas: A smartphone mobility study","Rout, A.; Nesbitt, L.","Urban planners and urban forestry researchers use various methods to evaluate how well different populations access the benefits of parks, often by assessing park distribution in relation to the social and economic conditions of surrounding neighbourhoods. However, without precise visitation data, it remains unclear whether proximity to parks translates into actual use. This study analyses the social and spatial factors influencing park visitation using real-world data across multiple urban and ecological contexts. We utilised smartphone mobility to capture visitation counts for over 14,000 parks across 10 US metropolitan areas, representing populations from more than 26,000 census block groups (CBGs). By integrating census data with spatial models, we examined the relationships between park visitation, proximity of parks to visitors' home neighbourhoods, and socio-economic variables such as race and ethnicity. Our analysis revealed that park visitation increases with proximity to visitors' home neighbourhoods. We also found positive associations between visitation rates and factors such as population density, median income, and park coverage in visitors' home neighbourhoods. Additionally, we identified significant correlations between park visitation and the racial and ethnic composition of these neighbourhoods. These findings confirm the assumption that closer proximity to parks enhances visitation rates. We recommend that park visitation data be considered alongside distributional analyses when planning for park accessibility. © 2024 The Authors",2024,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,101,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128557,#1472,Rout 2024,"Rout & Nesbitt, 2024",,,,,,,,,,,,
Exposure to parks through the lens of urban mobility,"Salgado, A.; Yuan, Z.; Caridi, I.; Gonzalez, M.C.","This work presents a portable framework to estimate potential park demand and park exposure through bipartite weighted networks. We use mobility information and open spatial information. Mobility information comes in the form of daily activities sampled from a model based on Call Detail Records (CDR). Spatial information comprise parks represented through OpenStreetMaps polygons and census tracts from the 2010 decennial US Census. The framework summarizes each city’s information into one bipartite weighted network with the link weights representing the number of potential visits to a park from each census tract on an average weekday. We compare park exposure and park demand in Greater Los Angeles and Greater Boston in a pre-pandemic scenario. The park exposure of a census tract is calculated as the number of parks surrounding the daily activities of its inhabitants. The demand of a park is calculated as the number of daily activities surrounding it. We find that both cities’ distribution of park exposure have similar shape with Boston having a higher average. On the other hand, the distribution of park demand is very similar in both cities, although their park spatial distributions are different. We include racial/ethnic information from the Census to explore how the park exposure connects tracts of different racial/ethnic groups. We associate parks to racial/ethnic groups based on the number of visitors from each group. Parks within minorities’ tracts are mostly used by majority groups. Finally, through detecting communities in the network, we find that park exposure connects the cities locally, linking parks to their tracts nearby. Furthermore, we find a significant spatial correlation between network communities and different racial/ethnic composition in Los Angeles. This way, patterns of park exposure reproduce the separation among demographic groups of the city. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,EPJ Data Science,11,1,,10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00351-9,#2849,Salgado 2022,"Salgado et al., 2022",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Are there relationships among racial segregation, economic isolation, and proximity to green space?","Saporito, S.; Casey, D.","Prior research has investigated differences in exposure to green space between racial and economic groups across the United States. Results have generally shown that people of color and lower-income groups tend to live in neighborhoods with less green space than their more-advantaged counterparts. Our research extends existing studies by measuring the association between racial and economic differences in exposure to green space and racial or economic segregation across neighborhoods within cities. Findings show that cities with lower levels of racial segregation exhibit smaller racial disparities in exposure to green space. By contrast, in cities with greater racial segregation, white people tend to live in neighborhoods with more green space than do people of color. This difference is more pronounced between white and Hispanic people. Finally, there is a strong association between segregation among different income groups and differences in exposure to green space between lower- and higher-income people. Consistent with much of the literature on racial and economic segregation—and studies of environment (in)justice—we find that lower-income people and members of minority groups live in neighborhoods with much less vegetation than their wealthier, white counterparts and these differences are exacerbated in racially and economically segregated cities. © 2015, Society for Human Ecology, All rights reserved.",2015,Human Ecology Review,21,2,113-131,10.22459/HER.21.02.2015.06,#5061,Saporito 2015,"Saporito & Casey, 2015",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Associations Between Historical Redlining and Present-Day Heat Vulnerability Housing and Land Cover Characteristics in Philadelphia, PA","Schinasi, L.H.; Kanungo, C.; Christman, Z.; Barber, S.; Philip-Tabb, L.P.; Headen, I.","Historical, institutional racism within the housing market may have impacted present-day disparities in heat vulnerability. We quantified associations between historically redlined areas with present-day property and housing characteristics that may enhance heat vulnerability in Philadelphia, PA. We used color-coded Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps and tax assessment data to randomly select 100 present-day (2018–2019) residential properties in each HOLC grade area (A = Best; B, C, and D = Most hazardous; N = 400 total). We conducted virtual inventories of the properties using aerial and streetview imagery for land cover and housing characteristics (dark roof color, flat roof shape, low or no mature tree canopy, no recently planted street trees) that may enhance heat vulnerability. We used modified Poisson regression models to estimate associations of HOLC grades with the property characteristics, unadjusted and adjusted for historical and contemporary measures of the neighborhood sociodemographic environment. Compared to grade A areas, higher proportions of properties in grade B, C, and D areas had dark roofs, low/no mature tree canopy, and no street trees. Adjusting for historical sociodemographics attenuated associations, with only associations with low or no tree canopy remaining elevated. Adjusting for present-day concentrated racial and socioeconomic deprivation did not substantially impact overall findings. In Philadelphia, PA, HOLC maps serve as spatial representations of present-day housing and land cover heat vulnerability characteristics.

"Shared streets, park closures and environmental justice during a pandemic emergency in Denver, Colorado","Scott, R.P.","Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic many municipalities closed or limited access to parks. A few also added new shared streets for citizens to recreate. This large and unprecedented change in the ability of residents to use green space provides an important case for assessing how emergency planning processes might differentially impact minority groups. Methods: Using the case of park closures and shared streets expansion in Denver, Colorado in March and April of 2020, this analysis evaluates how walking time and density of use at parks changed for different minority and income groups based on estimating park visits for residential blocks. Results: The analysis demonstrates that minority and low income groups were not disproportionately impacted by initial closures. Shared streets provide net decreases across the city in terms of travel time and density for recreational space usage, though there is some indication benefits were not equally distributed. Conclusion: The result emphasizes the importance of modern planning efforts and community engagement in ensuring equitable urban resilience while highlighting the potential for shared streets to provide more recreational accessibility if they can be equitably located. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,Journal of Transport and Health,21,,,10.1016/j.jth.2021.101075,#3570,Scott 2021,"Scott, 2021",,,,,,,,,,,,
Measuring equity through spatial variability of infrastructure systems across the urban-rural gradient,"Sen, S.K.; Pearsall, H.; H Gutierrez-Velez, V.H.; Gilbert, M.R.","Recent regional research has taken an ‘infrastructure turn’ where scholars have called for examining the transformative ability of different infrastructures in causing systemic inequities beyond the spatial conception of ‘urban and the other’. This research examines the interconnected impact of infrastructure systems on existing spatial inequities through a study in metropolitan Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This study investigates whether the urban-rural (U-R) gradient concept can enhance understanding of the spatial relationship between socioeconomic indicators and infrastructure systems. Indicators of spatial inequalities were regressed against infrastructure variables and imperviousness, as a proxy for the U-R gradient, using multivariate and spatial regression methods. The models show that imperviousness has a positive correlation with the concentration of racialized minorities and a negative correlation with access to health insurance. The study also shows that the predictive power of multiple infrastructures varies across space and does not adhere to urban boundaries or the U-R gradient. The complex interactions among different infrastructures shape inequities and require further inquiry in urban regions around the world. © 2021 by the authors.

Disparities in access to opportunities across neighborhoods types: a case study from the Los Angeles region,"Shin, E.J.","This study investigates the disparities in access to various types of opportunities in ethnic neighborhoods, as compared to wealthy white neighborhoods (the reference). Focusing on the heterogeneity within ethnic neighborhoods, I distinguish between different types of neighborhoods based on their racial/ethnic makeup and median household income. The Los Angeles region provides an interesting empirical setting because of its racial diversity and its auto-centric spatial structure. The results show that the various types of ethnic neighborhoods differ not only in spatial patterns within the region but also in terms of relative access to opportunities. Nevertheless, I find that all types of the low-income ethnic neighborhoods have higher levels of access to jobs and non-work opportunities, except for access to parks/open spaces, than do the reference neighborhoods. This holds true regardless of accessibility measures and travel modes. However, the relative access to opportunities for middle-to-high-income ethnic neighborhoods varies by accessibility measure. Considering that each accessibility measure has its own set of meanings and planning implications, diverse measures should be taken into account for policy interventions. The present study also adds further evidence of modal disparities, which are much greater than spatial disparities, in access to opportunities. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,Transportation,47,2,475-501,10.1007/s11116-018-9862-y,#4047,Shin 2020,"Shin, 2020",,,,,,,,,,,,
Understanding climate gentrification and shifting landscapes of protection and vulnerability in green resilient Philadelphia,"Shokry, G.; Connolly, J.J.; Anguelovski, I.","As resilience strategies become a prominent orthodoxy in city planning, green infrastructure is increasingly deployed to enhance protection from climate risks and impacts. Yet, little is known about the social and racial impacts of such interventions citywide. In response, our study uses a quantitative and spatial analytical approach to assess whether interventions we call “green resilient infrastructure” (GRI) protect social groups traditionally most at risk and/or least able to adapt to climate impacts – or conversely, if the aggregate effect is maladaptive and inequitable outcomes (i.e. shifting vulnerability or climate gentrification). First, we performed a pre-post test of GRI siting distribution relative to socioecological vulnerability in Philadelphia neighborhoods. Second, we examined gentrification trends in relation to GRI siting and whether these interventions contribute to increasing the socio-ecological vulnerability of historically marginalized populations. Our findings point to a strong negative association between GRI siting and increased minority population, and a strong positive association between GRI siting, gentrification, and reduced minority population. The paper contributes to a better understanding of siting inequities and urban climate injustice dynamics and offers a new conceptual frame for critical urban adaptation research and practice of the pathways that shape uneven and unjust outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2020,Urban Climate,31,,,10.1016/j.uclim.2019.100539,#4063,Shokry 2020,"Shokry et al., 2020",,,,,,,,,,,,

Three of the four resource densities (supermarkets/produce stores, retail areas, and recreational facilities) tended to be correlated with each other, whereas park density was less consistently and sometimes negatively correlated with others. Blacks were more likely to live in block groups with multiple low resource densities. Spatial regression models showed that block groups with higher proportions of black residents tended to have lower supermarket/produce, retail, and recreational facility densities, although these associations did not always achieve statistical significance. A measure that combined local and neighboring block group racial composition was often a stronger predictor of resources than the local measure alone.

"The urban growth machine, central place theory and access to open space","Smith, J.W.; Floyd, M.F.","The provision of urban open space occurs through political and economic mechanisms that could marginalize racial minority groups. In this research, we explore two competing hypotheses of marginalized access to open space (greenways, parks, and natural areas). The first hypothesis couples Logan and Molotch's ""growth machine"" theory with the concepts of laissez-faire racism and White privilege. Urban space is conceptualized as contested terrain being sought after by local elites who utilize their political and economic will to co-opt government decision making authority. The second hypothesis-central place theory-posits that access to open space is determined by the spatial patterns of economic agglomeration. Analyzing Raleigh, North Carolina as a case study, the results do not support either the growth machine theory or central place theory.

"Regulatory requirements and voluntary interventions create contrasting distributions of green stormwater infrastructure in Baltimore, Maryland","Solins, J.P.; Phillips de Lucas, A.K.; Brissette, L.E.G.; Morgan Grove, J.; Pickett, S.T.A.; Cadenasso, M.L.","Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) has been increasingly promoted as a strategy to augment gray infrastructure because it can reduce flooding, improve water quality, and provide additional social and ecological benefits. Government regulations in many places now require or encourage the use of GSI to mitigate impacts of development, while numerous funding opportunities incentivize installation of additional GSI features to enhance community and environmental benefits. The equity of GSI benefits may be affected by these different underlying motivations for GSI installation—mandatory compliance with regulations vs voluntary community improvement—which could create distinct patterns of GSI across the landscape. We examined this hypothesis in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, by comparing the city's database of GSI facilities that meet regulatory requirements (“regulatory GSI”) to a dataset we compiled of GSI installed voluntarily by nonprofit organizations and community groups (“voluntary GSI”). We found that regulatory GSI included more facility types than voluntary GSI, which was dominated by microscale practices like rain gardens. The presence of regulatory GSI was negatively related to greater Black populations, while voluntary GSI was more likely to be found both in low-income areas with predominantly Black populations and in high-income areas with predominantly white populations. Voluntary GSI was much more commonly located on public land, and GSI on public land tended to be in more disadvantaged areas. These patterns of GSI distribution, which reflect different motivations and constraints in a fragmented implementation process, provide an opportunity for improving equitable access to GSI benefits through more systematic planning and management efforts. © 2022 The Authors",2023,Landscape and Urban Planning,229,,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104607,#2779,Solins 2023,"Solins et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,

"Does exposure to air pollution in urban parks have socioeconomic, racial or ethnic gradients?","Su, J.G.; Jerrett, M.; de Nazelle, A.; Wolch, J.R.","Little is known about the levels of air pollution at public parks where regular exercise takes place or in park-adjacent neighborhoods where people have easy access to parks. In this study we investigated the ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO<inf>2</inf>), fine particulate (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and ozone (O<inf>3</inf>) at public parks and in park-adjacent neighborhoods for metropolitan Los Angeles. Socioeconomic and racial-ethnic inequalities in exposure to the three criteria pollutants were also investigated using multiple linear regression models. In addition, differences in inhalation doses from breathing the three +criteria pollutants were investigated for the top and bottom quartile racial composition in the parks and neighborhoods. Our research showed that although public parks had on average the lowest pollutant concentrations of NO<inf>2</inf> and PM<inf>2.5</inf>, they had relatively high O<inf>3</inf> concentrations. Park-adjacent neighborhoods, by contrast, had the highest NO<inf>2</inf> and PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations, but the lowest O<inf>3</inf> concentrations. Higher exposures to NO<inf>2</inf> and PM<inf>2.5</inf> were systematically identified for the lower socioeconomic position or higher minority population neighborhoods. For children and adolescents aged 6-15 engaging in high and moderate intensity activities in and around public parks, those from the top quartile of primarily Hispanic neighborhoods had much higher (63%) inhaled doses of NO<inf>2</inf> compared to the bottom quartile counterpart. PM<inf>2.5</inf> showed a similar but less pronounced pattern of inhalation doses. Evidence of socioeconomic and racial-ethnic gradients was found in air pollution exposure and inhalation doses in and around the urban parks in Los Angeles.

However, emerging evidence indicates that greenspace also provides substantial health benefits in rural and suburban areas, challenging the urban-centric bias. This study addresses these gaps by conducting a comprehensive spatial analysis in North Carolina, focusing on greenspace disparities (e.g., greenspace per person, greenspace area, trail length per person) faced by overburdened and marginalized populations. Using a spatial durbin model, we assessed direct and indirect effects, including demographic factors and spillover impacts from neighboring communities. Results revealed that greenspace per person is negatively associated with youth presence (β = − 0.102, p = 0.012) and lower education levels (β = − 0.102, p = 0.045). Rural tracts exhibit higher greenspace availability per person (β = 0.135, p = 0.007), though often lacking in recreational amenities. Playgrounds showed contrasting trends, with higher income (β = 0.446, p = 0.042) and youth presence (β = 0.591, p = 0.001) linked to increased playground space, while rural (β = − 0.827, p < 0.001) and Hispanic populations (β = − 0.599, p = 0.001) faced deficits. Trail length analysis highlighted indirect positive effects for Black populations (lagged β = 0.605, p = 0.004) and income (lagged β = 0.536, p = 0.026) in neighboring tracts, offset by negative youth impacts (lagged β = − 0.831, p < 0.001). Contrary to expectations, no significant direct association was found between Black residents and greenspace within tracts. Instead, socioeconomic class emerged as a more critical determinant, with lower-income areas facing deficits and higher-income areas benefiting from increased greenspace. Additionally, areas with limited greenspace access experience heightened heat risks, underscoring broader environmental disparities. These findings highlight the need for localized and spillover-sensitive approaches to greenspace planning, addressing barriers for marginalized communities and mitigating environmental inequities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.",2025,GeoJournal,90,2,,10.1007/s10708-025-11328-2,#824,Sugg 2025,"Sugg et al., 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,

Using machine learning to examine street green space types at a high spatial resolution: Application in Los Angeles County on socioeconomic disparities in exposure,"Sun, Y.; Wang, X.; Zhu, J.; Chen, L.; Jia, Y.; Lawrence, J.M.; Jiang, L.-H.; Xie, X.; Wu, J.","Background: Compared to commonly-used green space indicators from downward-facing satellite imagery, street view-based green space may capture different types of green space and represent how environments are perceived and experienced by people on the ground, which is important to elucidate the underlying mechanisms linking green space and health. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate machine learning models that can classify the type of vegetation (i.e., tree, low-lying vegetation, grass) from street view images; and to investigate the associations between street green space and socioeconomic (SES) factors, in Los Angeles County, California. Methods: SES variables were obtained from the CalEnviroScreen3.0 dataset. Microsoft Bing Maps images in conjunction with deep learning were used to measure total and types of street view green space, which were compared to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as commonly-used satellite-based green space measure. Generalized linear mixed model was used to examine associations between green space and census tract SES, adjusting for population density and rural/urban status. Results: The accuracy of the deep learning model was high with 92.5% mean intersection over union. NDVI were moderately correlated with total street view-based green space and tree, and weakly correlated with low-lying vegetation and grass. Total and three types of green space showed significant negative associations with neighborhood SES. The percentage of total green space decreased by 2.62 [95% confidence interval (CI): −3.02, −2.21, p < 0.001] with each interquartile range increase in CalEnviroScreen3.0 score. Disadvantaged communities contained approximately 5% less average street green space than other communities. Conclusion: Street view imagery coupled with deep learning approach can accurately and efficiently measure eye-level street green space and distinguish vegetation types. In Los Angeles County, disadvantaged communities had substantively less street green space.

In part, this may be caused by the methodological difficulties involved in trying to link these distributions. In this paper, I offer a methodological as well as an empirical contribution to the assessment of equitability in facility distribution. Utilizing data on parks in Pueblo, Colorado, and Macon, Georgia, I analyze the equitability of park distribution by comparing the spatial clustering of park access scores with the spatial clustering of selected socioeconomic variables. There is some empirical evidence that the spatial pattern of low access for Macon corresponds in certain areas to spatial clusters of high housing value and low percentages of non-White residents, while the reverse situation is true for Pueblo (i.e., low access corresponds with low housing value and high percentages of Hispanics). Thus, the results of the analysis do not support the notion of “unpatterned inequality” in urban service distribution. The paper is an application of ideas from exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and represents a new approach to the investigation of equity in the distribution of urban park facilities. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Who can walk? An analysis of public amenity access in America’s ten largest cities,"Talen, E.","How uneven is the proximity to public amenities like libraries and schools among racial groups, or children and older people? This paper uses a catchment area approach to evaluate walkable proximity to four common public amenities (parks, libraries, schools, and transit stops), looking at four racial categories and a set of variables that one might reasonably expect proximity to be related to (e.g., population density). For each of the 10 largest US cities examined, location quotients for each amenity (libraries, parks, schools, and transit stops) were calculated at three distances (0.25 miles, 0.5 miles, and 1 mile). Across all amenities, the racial group whose LQ had the greatest increase when comparing net median change between distance bands (i.e., between.25 miles and 1 mile) was Black Americans. There were large differences between the location quotient means and medians in non-White racial groups for each amenity, indicating a large amount of skew. In most cities and with most amenities, the difference between mean and median was considerably smaller in White populations, indicating a more normal curve and fewer outliers. Proximity, in other words, seems to be more homogenous in White populations. The LQs were also significantly higher in White populations across cities. Further, in all cities except Los Angeles, Asian populations were generally the most under-represented group for each catchment area around each amenity. The fact that non-White residents predominantly had lower LQs and therefore lower access (with some exceptions, for example, in the case of schools) is a generalized and problematic finding that adds to the body of evidence documenting the spatial injustices that American cities continue to manifest. © The Author(s) 2022.",2023,Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science,50,7,1775-1789,10.1177/23998083221142866,#2359,Talen 2023,"Talen, 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
The National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network Access to Parks Indicator: A National County-Level Measure of Park Proximity.,"Ussery, EN; Yngve, L; Merriam D; Whitfield G; Foster S; Wendel A; Boehmer T","Parks and recreation departments and public health organizations both work to improve the well-being of their communities. Measuring residential proximity to parks could be a specific area of shared interest, given that proximity to parks is needed for walking access, and the use of parks is, in turn, associated with many physical, social, and mental health benefits. The CDC's publicly available National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (NEPHTN) Access to Parks Indicator (API) focuses on one major component of access, residential proximity to parks. The API uses a commercial parks database and U.S. Census data to estimate the number and percentage of individuals in the U.S. that live within a half-mile of a park boundary, a measure commonly used to represent park proximity. The API is calculated at the state and county levels and is available for all states and counties in the U.S. Using estimates from the API, we examined the distribution of residential proximity to parks by geography and race/ethnicity. Additionally, we evaluated differences in park proximity by rural/urban status of counties. In 2010, 39% of the total U.S. population lived within a half-mile of a park. This percentage varied widely between states, ranging from 9% in West Virginia to 67% in Hawaii and 88% in the District of Columbia (DC). Park proximity was lowest among non-Hispanic whites (34.2%) and highest among individuals belonging to the non-Hispanic other race category (52.0%). Metropolitan counties had the highest percentage of residents living within a half-mile of a park (43.3%); the percentage was lower in non-metropolitan counties adjacent to a metropolitan county (15.0%) and non-metropolitan counties not adjacent to a metropolitan county (18.5%). Park proximity was higher in metropolitan counties with a larger population size and in non-metropolitan counties with a higher degree of urbanization. The NEPHTN Access to Parks Indicator provides an opportunity to understand park proximity in counties and states throughout the U.S., including identifying disparities that may exist between population subgroups and comparing geographic areas. Parks and recreational professionals can use this information to compare their county or state to other geographic areas and, in combination with local data on parks within their jurisdiction, inform decisions to improve the distribution of parks and the well-being of their communities.",2016,J Park Recreat Admi,34,3,52-63,10.18666/JPRA-2016-V34-I3-7119,#5959,Ussery 2016,"Ussery et al., 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,
Greenway development and gentrification,"VanCeylon, J.; Melstrom, R.T.","This paper presents research on expanding access to green spaces in developed areas. Critics claim greenway projects lead to gentrification by increasing the demand for housing and pushing out residents in nearby neighborhoods. We look for evidence of this phenomenon using a sorting model and panel data on aggregate populations in Atlanta. Near the center of the city is a 22-mile greenway known as the BeltLine. Although behaviors initiated within the first half of the study period are consistent with gentrification, we find weak evidence that sorting-based disparities in the post-project period can be attributed to the location and timing of access to BeltLine amenities. © 2025 The Southern Economic Association.",2025,Southern Economic Journal,,,,10.1002/soej.12768,#965,VanCeylon 2025,"VanCeylon & Melstrom, 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,
Disproportionalities in the urban forest: Analyzing the role of stewardship agencies in dictating the distribution of an urban environmental resource,"Varuzzo, A.; Harvey, D.C.","Environmental stewardship in urban areas often involves multiple organizations and actors. Yet very little data exists that takes into account the work of multiple stewardship organizations. And while recent work has presented various drivers of uneven canopy cover, the contribution of local stewardship organizations to those inequalities remains under-explored. Worcester, MA, however, offers an interesting opportunity to look at how unequitable canopies can be reproduced. In 2008, after the Asian Longhorned beetle was discovered in Worcester, Worcester County began a sustained eradication effort and destroyed over 34,000 trees in just six years. Multiple organizations took on the responsibility for restoring the canopy. In this paper, we analyze where the stewardship organizations planted new trees and the main drivers of planting in those locations. Specifically, we explore (1) if the restoration of the canopy was done in an equitable manner, and (2) what were the main predictors of where stewardship organizations worked. Our findings indicate that the inequity in the canopy was reproduced after the Longhorned beetle epidemic. More surprising is that in the spatial error regression model traditional drivers of inequities in the canopy become insignificant. The most significant predictor of where stewardship agencies worked is the presence of other agencies. We end with some recommendations for a more efficient, holistic stewardship environment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2017,Landscape and Urban Planning,167,,232-239,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.06.006,#4679,Varuzzo 2017,"Varuzzo & Harvey, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Exploring the distribution of park availability, features, and quality across Kansas City, Missouri by income and race/ethnicity: an environmental justice investigation.","Vaughan, KB; Kaczynski AT; Wilhelm Stanis SA; Besenyi GM; Bergstrom R; Heinrich KM","BACKGROUND: Parks are key community assets for physical activity, but some evidence suggests these resources are not equitably distributed. PURPOSE: This study examined disparities by income and race/ethnicity in the availability, features, and quality of parks across Kansas City, Missouri. METHODS: All parks and census tracts (CTs) were mapped using geographical information systems, and park features and quality were determined via audits. Multivariate analyses of covariance analyzed differences in park availability, features, and quality across low-, medium-, and high-income and race/ethnicity CT tertiles. RESULTS: Low-income CTs contained significantly more parks, but also had fewer parks with playgrounds and more quality concerns per park. High minority CTs had more parks with basketball courts, but fewer parks with trails. Medium-income CTs contained more aesthetic features per park. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should examine policies that contribute to and that might rectify disparities in park features and quality, especially in low-income and high minority areas.",2013,Ann Behav Med,45 Suppl 1,,S28-38,10.1007/s12160-012-9425-y,#6256,Vaughan 2013,"Vaughan et al., 2013",,,,,,,,,,,,
Monitoring temporal changes in large urban street trees using remote sensing and deep learning,"Velasquez-Camacho, L.; van Doorn, N.; Preisler, H.; Etxegarai, M.; Alas, O.; Gonzalez Castro, J.M.; de Miguel, S.","In the rapidly changing dynamics of urbanization, urban forests offer numerous benefits to city dwellers. However, the information available on these resources is often outdated or non-existent, leading in part to inequitable access to these benefits for the population. Access to equitable and just green spaces is a challenge for local governments, allowing the city’s inhabitants to enjoy a healthy environment. In this context, remote sensing serves as a powerful data source that enables the monitoring of the evolution and dynamics of cities over time, as well as changes in urban forests. For this study, our focus is on large trees, defined as those with a canopy diameter exceeding seven meters. These trees play a vital role in offering ecosystem services that improve the environment, biodiversity, and mental health of the inhabitants of cities. Using deep learning algorithms, we identify the large urban street trees in National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) images and analyze the changes in large street trees over an 18-year period (2005–2022) in six counties of the San Francisco Bay Area. We successfully tracked changes in the presence of large trees in the public right-of-way at the census tract, city, and county levels. We tracked changes in large tree availability at the neighborhood, city, and county levels, revealing socio-demographic disparities. Our analysis found that census tracts with higher household incomes, a greater proportion of individuals who self-identify as white, and more families were positively associated with an increase in large tree canopy. This assessment provides insight into the varying levels of access to ecosystem services offered by large trees across urban environments.

Yet, historical residential segregation in the USA has resulted in poor quality urban parks near neighborhoods with primarily disadvantaged socioeconomic status groups, and an extensive park system that addresses the needs of primarily White middle-class residents. Here we center the voices of historically marginalized urban residents by using Natural Language Processing and Geographic Information Science to analyze a large dataset (n = 143,913) of Google Map reviews from 2011 to 2022 across 285 parks in the City of Philadelphia, USA. We find that parks in neighborhoods with a high number of residents from historically disadvantaged demographic groups are likely to receive lower scores on Google Maps. Physical characteristics of these parks based on aerial and satellite images and ancillary data corroborate the public perception of park quality.

Spatial disparities in neighborhood public tree coverage: Do modes of transportation matter?,"Wang, H.; Qiu, F.","Urban green space has various environmental and ecological benefits, and uneven access to such amenities has drawn substantial attention from policy makers in developing sustainable community planning. In this study, we illustrate the spatial distribution of publicly owned and maintained trees in Edmonton, Canada and assess neighborhoods’ heterogeneous tree availability by using the container approach. Through spatial regression models, we further investigate the association of neighborhood public tree availability with socio-economic status (SES). We contribute to the existing literature by taking resident modes of transportation into consideration, in addition to many other commonly examined SES such as household income and ethnicity. Another unique contribution of this study is that we distinguish trees planted on different location types (i.e., boulevard, park, and buffer areas) when exploring the unequal coverage across neighborhoods and among different SES groups. Key results include: (1) a general examination without differentiating location types can lead to misleading results and thus provide inappropriate policy recommendations; (2) resident modes of transportation is a critical factor associated with a neighborhood's public tree coverage; and (3) there exists evident spatial dependence on public tree availability between neighborhoods. The results from this study provide important information to better understand the issue and to allocate public resource (such as tree coverage) more efficiently and effectively to support sustainable community development. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",2018,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,29,,58-67,10.1016/j.ufug.2017.11.001,#4651,Wang 2018,"Wang & Qiu, 2018",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Multi-scale analysis of urban forests and socioeconomic patterns in a desert city, Phoenix, Arizona","Wang, Z.; Fan, C.; Que, X.; Liao, F.H.; Ma, X.; Wang, H.","Understanding the relationship between various socioeconomic factors and urban forest structure is essential for directing resources to ensure equitable distribution of green space. Through a case study of a desert city, i.e., Phoenix, AZ, this study provides a novel application of Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) in which we explore the spatially variable relationships between a wide array of socioeconomic indicators and urban forest attributes. Through the computation of various scales of influence for different explanatory variables, MGWR enhances our analysis’s precision and stresses the association between socioeconomic status and urban forest structure at local and regional scales. Our results indicate that although there has been a pattern of green inequality where minority and low-income communities have less access to urban forests, education levels were mostly insignificant based on the MGWR results. In some instances, higher incomes are negatively correlated with tree canopy coverage. Additionally, the stem density model outperformed the canopy coverage model in terms of prediction accuracy.

Socio-Ecological Impacts of the Investment of Urban Nature in Heat Mitigation for Two Megacities,"Wang, J.; Zhou, W.; McPhearson, T.; Cook, E.M.; Herreros-Cantis, P.; Liu, J.","Cities are increasingly adapting green interventions meant to enhance climate resilience, given their capacity to provide numerous ecosystem services (ES). Yet, little is known about ecological and social impacts of such interventions in the context of socio-ecological framework and environmental justice. Here, we used a quantitative and spatial analytical approach to assess the changes of urban greenspace (UG) and examine the equity of changes in ES supply and demand across demographic and socioeconomic groups in Beijing and NYC between 2010 and 2017. Results showed that previously existing green space and its expansion were unevenly distributed across districts. High-income districts in NYC had high green cover and experienced the highest increase of UG, in contrast to high green cover in areas with low population density and the greatest increase of UG in high-income areas for Beijing, respectively. The inequitable distribution of UG resulted in a high level of mismatch in supply demand of ES, revealing a pattern of distributional ecological injustice within city. We also found more ecological supply was provided in the areas having less vulnerability, indicating that social vulnerability remained in a lower greenspace exposure after greening implementation in both cities.

"Is Planting Equitable? An Examination of the Spatial Distribution of Nonprofit Urban Tree-Planting Programs by Canopy Cover, Income, Race, and Ethnicity","Watkins, S.L.; Mincey, S.K.; Vogt, J.; Sweeney, S.P.","This article examines the spatial distribution of tree-planting projects undertaken by four urban greening nonprofit organizations in the Midwest and Eastern United States. We use a unique data set of tree-planting locations, land use data, and socioeconomic information to predict whether a census block group (n = 3,771) was the location of a tree-planting project between 2009 and 2011. Regression results show tree-planting projects were significantly less likely to have occurred in block groups with higher tree canopy cover, higher median income, or greater percentages of African American or Hispanic residents, controlling for physical and socioeconomic conditions. In addition, when canopy cover or income was low, plantings were even less likely to have occurred in neighborhoods with high percentages of racial or ethnic minorities. Findings suggest nonprofit plantings might reduce existing income-based inequity in canopy cover, but risk creating or exacerbating race-based inequity and risk leaving low canopy minority neighborhoods with relatively few program benefits. © 2016, © 2016 The Author(s).",2017,Environment and Behavior,49,4,452-482,10.1177/0013916516636423,#4724,Watkins 2017,"Watkins et al., 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,
A data-driven investigation on park visitation and income mixing of visitors in New York City,"Wei, H.; Huang, X.; Wang, S.; Lu, J.; Li, Z.; Zhu, L.","It is crucial to understand the current pattern of urban park visitation to achieve environmental justice. Current discussions of environmental equity of parks mainly focus on the inequality provision measured by park accessibility, park area, park quality, and park congestion, ignoring the inequity of social benefits through interactions among mixed-income groups. Based on fine-grained mobile phone location data at the census block group level in 2018 and 2019, we explored visitation patterns and the mixed-income levels of visitors in urban parks in New York City. The visitors were divided into five income groups, with the “income entropy” used as a measure of the mixed level of the visitors in terms of income groups. We answered an important question: what factors affect the visitation intensity and the mixed level of income groups in urban park visitors? Our results revealed that the time of year and season, the parks’ characteristics, the built environment, and the socioeconomic characteristics of the park’s surrounding neighborhoods have strong associations with park use patterns. We also offered implications for urban planning and urban design to promote park visitation and income-diverse park use and improve social inclusion and environmental equity. © The Author(s) 2022.",2023,Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science,50,3,796-813,10.1177/23998083221130708,#2559,Wei 2023,"Wei et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
Reconsidering Access: Park Facilities and Neighborhood Disamenities in New York City,"Weiss, CC; Purciel, M; Bader, M; Quinn, JW; Lovasi, G; Neckerman, KM; Rundle, AG","With increasing concern about rising rates of obesity, public health researchers have begun to examine the availability of parks and other spaces for physical activity, particularly in cities, to assess whether access to parks reduces the risk of obesity. Much of the research in this field has shown that proximity to parks may support increased physical activity in urban environments; however, as yet, there has been limited consideration of environmental impediments or disamenities that might influence individuals' perceptions or usage of public recreation opportunities. Prior research suggests that neighborhood disamenities, for instance crime, pedestrian safety, and noxious land uses, might dissuade people from using parks or recreational facilities and vary by neighborhood composition. Motivated by such research, this study estimates the relationship between neighborhood compositional characteristics and measures of park facilities, controlling for variation in neighborhood disamenities, using geographic information systems (GIS) data for New York City parks and employing both kernel density estimation and distance measures. The central finding is that attention to neighborhood disamenities can appreciably alter the relationship between neighborhood composition and spatial access to parks.

Assessing equitable access to urban green space: The role of engineered water infrastructure,"Wendel, H.E.W.; Downs, J.A.; Mihelcic, J.R.","Urban green space and water features provide numerous social, environmental, and economic benefits, yet disparities often exist in their distribution and accessibility. This study examines the link between issues of environmental justice and urban water management to evaluate potential improvements in green space and surface water access through the revitalization of existing engineered water infrastructures, namely stormwater ponds. First, relative access to green space and water features were compared for residents of Tampa, Florida, and an inner-city community of Tampa (East Tampa). Although disparities were not found in overall accessibility between Tampa and East Tampa, inequalities were apparent when quality, diversity, and size of green spaces were considered. East Tampa residents had significantly less access to larger, more desirable spaces and water features. Second, this research explored approaches for improving accessibility to green space and natural water using three integrated stormwater management development scenarios. These scenarios highlighted the ability of enhanced water infrastructures to increase access equality at a variety of spatial scales.

Accessible Green Spaces? Spatial Disparities in Residential Green Space among People with Disabilities in the United States,"Wong, S.; Rush, J.; Bailey, F.; Just, A.C.","This article presents new quantitative results on the distribution of residential green space for people with disabilities in the United States, building on and bridging scholarly research in two distinct domains: one involving approaches that quantify disparities in green space access among racialized minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and the other using qualitative methods that demonstrate that most green spaces remain inaccessible and unwelcoming to disabled visitors. Using generalized additive models (GAMs) that controlled for demographic factors and climatological characteristics, we find that residential areas with more green space generally have a higher proportion of disabled residents. The statistical results run counter to expectations from the literature, thus complicating the prevailing narrative and indicating a need for mixed-methods research to examine multiple dimensions of access and environmental justice. Using cluster analysis to assess spatial trends, we detect residential clusters of high disability and low green space and find that they are located in predominantly non-White, urban, and more socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods compared to clusters of high disability and high green space.

Disparities in disc golf course distribution in the United States,"Woods, J.; Cossman, J.S.; Wolf, J.K.","Research questions: To what extent are racial, socioeconomic and health characteristics of US counties associated with access to a specific recreational resource–disc golf courses? We contribute to the literature by using a national scope and exploring how these relationships vary along the rural-urban continuum. Research methods: We use data from six sources to (1) map the county-level locations of disc golf courses, (2) provide descriptives of the sociodemographic and health characteristics for US counties, including by rural-urban distinctions and by presence/absence of at least one disc golf course and (3) show via multivariate logistic regression the relationship between these county-level variables and the presence of at least one disc golf course for US counties and by rural-urban distinction (N = 3,138). Results and findings: Disc golf courses exist throughout the US, but are prevalent in the upper Midwest, the mid-Atlantic I-95 corridor, the Pacific Coast and New England. A greater proportion of urban counties have disc golf courses than rural counties. Counties are more likely to have a disc golf course as poverty and the percent of black residents decrease and as educational attainment and percent of residents under age 25 increase. However, when looking only at urban counties, the relationship between poverty and disc golf availability reverses–poverty is positively associated with the presence of a disc golf course. Healthier counties are associated with a higher likelihood of disc golf presence but do little to improve model fit. Implications: The findings provide evidence in favor of both sides of an ongoing empirical debate about racial and socioeconomic inequities in access to recreational resources. At the national level, the findings support the many studies showing that poorer, black communities tend to have fewer activity-supportive resources than richer, white communities. However, the results also partially support several urban-based studies that have refuted these relationships. While contributing to this important debate, we also argue that disc golf courses can be creatively built in areas with fewer financial resources, thereby lessoning the inequities in access to health-benefiting public recreation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2023,Managing Sport and Leisure,28,2,105-119,10.1080/23750472.2020.1856711,#2798,Woods 2023,"Woods et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
Green infrastructure inequality in the context of COVID-19: Taking parks and trails as examples,"Wu, Y.; Wei, Y.D.; Liu, M.; Garcia, I.","Urban green infrastructures play a critical role in enhancing the well-being of residents, yet their equitable access remains a concern, particularly during the COVID-19 outbreak. There is a lack of knowledge on how people respond to the pandemic regarding the usage of green infrastructure in cities. This paper explores the shifts in visitation to parks and trails, two popular types of green infrastructures in Salt Lake County, Utah, by analyzing the results of a survey conducted during the pandemic. Our conceptualization considers personal and neighborhood level factors, including personal socioeconomic status, existing inequalities of green infrastructures, urban form, and neighborhood conditions. People who reside close to the city center tend to go to parks more often, while those living in urban edges use trails more. Visiting green infrastructures less often is more likely in areas with higher COVID-19 infection rates. The regression results confirm the importance of neighborhood level factors and illustrate the intricate elements influencing people's decisions to visit different green infrastructures during the pandemic, which shows non-linear relationships. Wealthier, white, and younger people seem to enjoy green infrastructures more often, leading to the concern of amplified inequality. Higher COVID-19 cases result in higher demands for green infrastructures, which are not fulfilled during the pandemic, especially for vulnerable communities, leading to spatial exclusion. The findings highlight the importance of smart growth, including compact development, public transit, and pocket parks, in promoting the urban resilience of park and trail visits, as they may provide more opportunities for access and alternatives to green infrastructures even in the context of the pandemic. © 2023",2023,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,86,,,10.1016/j.ufug.2023.128027,#2379,Wu 2023,"Wu et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
Greenspace equity across variation in residential densities: Insights for urban sustainability,"Wu, J.; Wang, L.; Pijanowski, B.; Omrani, H.; Liang, A.","The enhancement of eco-social services provided by greenspace enhances human well-being and supports sustainable urban development. The United Nations has explicitly emphasized the need to “ensure the availability of greenspaces for urban residents” in SDG11. Nonetheless, with the current trends of urban sprawl and residential densification, greenspace shrinkage and degradation are accelerating, thereby diminishing its multifaceted benefits. These trends have also exacerbated inequalities and environmental justice issues. The disparity in greenspace exposure and its inequality across residential areas with varying densities has also been further exacerbated during this process. However, the specific magnitude and trend of change in this disparity were still poorly understood. To address this gap, we incorporated a random forest algorithm-based 30-m time-series greenspace mapping and an RSEI-based population-weighted exposure framework to quantify spatiotemporal variations in human exposure to greenspace across residential areas of varying densities in 154 cities at the patch scale. Finally, the Gini coefficient and MGWR were combined to assess the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of inequality in greenspace exposure and its influencing factors. Results indicated that greenspace exposure was greater in low-density residential areas than in high-density areas (0.72 vs 0.16), while equality was weaker (Gini coefficient:0.83 vs 0.61), both gaps have shown a tendency to narrow over time. Greenspace exposure equality was primarily driven by greenspace quality rather than its coverage ratio (Beta: −0.434 vs 0.40, P < 0.05). These findings contribute to our understanding of greenspace inequality in residential areas of different densities, suggesting directions for optimizing greenspace layout and offering new insights for sustainable urban development. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2025,Habitat International,157,,,10.1016/j.habitatint.2025.103310,#860,Wu 2025,"Wu et al., 2025b",,,,,,,,,,,,
The racial inequity of park visitation behavior in the post-pandemic era,"Wu, XY; Lu, Y; Wei, D; Chen, WY","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing racial disparities in park usage. Although numerous studies have reported a widened racial inequity in park visitation during the pandemic, it remains unclear how this inequity has dynamically evolved in post-pandemic era. In this study, using nationwide location-based mobile data from SafeGraph's Monthly Patterns dataset and the linear mixed effects model, we analyzed fouryear longitudinal change (2018-2021) in park visitation behaviors among racially distinct neighborhoods and examined whether neighborhood greenness moderated these disparities in the United States. The results demonstrate that: (1) racial inequity in park visitation has continued to widen over the two-year pandemic period; (2) while park visitation across all groups has gradually returned to and even surpassed pre-pandemic levels, Black-majority groups consistently exhibited lower visit counts and fewer visited parks than Black-minority groups; and (3) neighborhood greenness significantly mitigates racial disparities in park visitation, with higher greenness levels associated with reduced inequity. These findings point out the potential impact of neighborhood greenness on alleviating racial inequity in park visits.",2025,TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY,41,,,10.1016/j.tbs.2025.101105,#6856,Wu 2025,"Wu et al., 2025a",,,,,,,,,,,,
Exploring the role of green space in mitigating childhood opportunity across the U.S,"Yang, J.; Ury, B.; Dunsiger, S.I.; Grigsby-Toussaint, D.S.","Green space exposure enhances children’s well-being and has the potential to mitigate the impact of neighborhood deprivation. However, racial and ethnic disparities in green space availability persist, limiting the potential for equitable access and benefits for children. The Child Opportunity Index (COI) 3.0 was used to measure neighborhood opportunity, while tree canopy coverage and the normalized difference vegetation index were used to assess green space exposure. Tukey’s test and correlation analysis were employed to evaluate the relationship between green space, children’s neighborhood opportunities, and race or ethnicity across the U.S. at the census-tract level. Census tracts with lower COI scores have significantly less green space than those with higher COI scores, and a significantly higher proportion of Hispanic children live in neighborhoods with limited green space exposure (p < 0.05). The percentage of Hispanic children in a neighborhood shows significant negative associations with all green space measures, with a stronger negative association in high-deprivation neighborhoods compared to low-deprivation neighborhoods (− 0.2 versus − 0.5, p < 0.05). Communities of color disproportionately experience both neighborhood deprivation and limited access to green space, and green space does not currently mitigate the impact of growing up in a deprived neighborhood. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,Scientific Reports,15,1,,10.1038/s41598-025-18374-3,#183,Yang 2025,"Yang et al., 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,
Greenness and equity: Complex connections between intra-neighborhood contexts and residential tree planting implementation,"Yeager, R; Browning, MHEM; Breyer, E; Ossola, A; Larson, LR; Riggs, DW; Rigolon, A; Chandler, C; Fleischer, D; Keith, R; Walker, K; Hart, JL; Smith, T; Bhatnagar, A","Associations between neighborhood greenness and socioeconomic status (SES) are established, yet intraneighborhood context and SES-related barriers to tree planting remain unclear. Large-scale tree planting implementation efforts are increasingly common and can improve human health, strengthen climate adaptation, and ameliorate environmental inequities. Yet, these efforts may be ineffective without in-depth understanding of local SES inequities and barriers to residential planting. We recruited 636 residents within and surrounding the Oakdale Neighborhood of Louisville, Kentucky, USA, and evaluated associations of individual and neighborhood-level sociodemographic indicators with greenness levels at multiple scales. We offered no-cost residential tree planting and maintenance to residents within a subsection of the neighborhood and examined associations of these sociodemographic indicators plus baseline greenness levels with tree planting adoption among 215 eligible participants. We observed positive associations of income with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and leaf area index (LAI) within all radii around homes, and within yards of residents, that varied in strength. There were stronger associations of income with NDVI in front yards but LAI in back yards. Among Participants of Color, associations between income and NDVI were stronger than with Whites and exhibited no association with LAI. Tree planting uptake was not associated with income, education, race, nor employment status, but was positively associated with lot size, home value, lower population density, and area greenness. Our findings reveal significant complexity of intra-neighborhood associations between SES and greenness that could help shape future research and equitable greening implementation. Results show that previously documented links between SES and greenspace at large scales extend to residents' yards, highlighting opportunities to redress greenness inequities on private property. Our analysis found that uptake of no-cost residential planting and maintenance was nearly equal across SES groups but did not redress greenness inequity. To inform equitable greening, further research is needed to evaluate culture, norms, perceptions, and values affecting tree planting acceptance among low-SES residents.",2023,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,176,,,10.1016/j.envint.2023.107955,#7642,Yeager 2023,"Yeager et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Understanding and assessing demographic (in)equity resulting from extreme heat and direct sunlight exposure due to lack of tree canopies in Norfolk, VA using agent-based modeling","Zamponi, V.; O'Brien, K.; Jensen, E.; Feldhaus, B.; Moore, R.; Lynch, C.J.; Gore, R.","Prolonged exposure to extreme heat and direct sunlight can result in illness and death. In urban areas of dense concentrations of pavement, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat, harmful environmental exposures to extreme heat and direct sunlight for residents can occur on a daily basis during certain parts of the year. Tree canopies provide shade and help to cool the environment, making mature trees with large canopies a simple and effective way to reduce urban heat and avoid direct sunlight. We develop a demographically representative agent-based model to understand the extent to which different demographics of residents in Norfolk, VA are (in)equitably shaded from direct sunlight and extreme heat conditions during a walk on a clear summer day. In the model each agent represents a different resident of Norfolk, VA. We use the model to assess the extent to which the city's tree planting plan will be effective in remediating any existing inequities. Our results show that inequitable conditions exist for residents at (1) different education levels, (2) different income levels, and (3) living in different census tracts. Norfolk's Tree Planting Program effectively reduces the distance residents of all demographics walk in extreme heat and are exposed to direct sunlight. However, residents of the city at lower income levels still experience statistically significantly more extreme heat and direct sunlight exposure due to a lack of tree canopies in summer months than those at higher income levels. © 2023 The Author(s)",2023,Ecological Modelling,483,,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2023.110445,#2345,Zamponi 2023,"Zamponi et al., 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Investigating spatial heterogeneity of park inequity using three access measures: A case study in Hartford, Connecticut","Zhang, P.; Park, S.","Park inequity has been widely examined in U.S. cities, yet the results were inconclusive. This gap is possibly because of the consideration of one single aspect of access at a time and the lack of examination of spatial dependency and heterogeneity when modeling the relationship between park access and the socioeconomic status of populations. This study aims to contribute to these gaps in the studies of park equity by investigating park inequity using three access measures—park proximity, park congestion, and park crime—in Hartford, Connecticut. As a result, park proximity, park congestion, and park crime presented distinct spatial patterns and low correlations with each other. In addition, the results of geographically weighted regressions uncovered spatial heterogeneity in the relationships between the three park access measures and socioeconomic variables and confirmed that the relationships are location-specific with varying magnitudes and signs of the coefficients. In particular, median house value was associated with less park crowdedness particularly in White and Hispanic neighborhoods. Furthermore, southern neighborhoods showed more park crime disparities in relation to race, education, and income levels. The multidimensional and spatially heterogeneous patterns of park inequity inform urban planning on how to strategically allocate resources in pursuit of environmental justice. © 2022",2023,Applied Geography,151,,,10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.102857,#2597,Zhang 2023,"Zhang & Park, 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,
The importance of differentiating urban and rural phenomena in examining the unequal distribution of locally desirable land,"Zhang, Y.; Tarrant, M.A.; Green, G.T.","Previous research addressing the unequal distribution of locally desirable land (LDL) has mainly ignored their associated environments (i.e., rural or urban). However, this study proposed a new framework that treats rural and urban regions separately. In rural areas, the LDLs included all public lands. In urbanized areas, the LDLs were defined as green open spaces. Potential inequities in the distribution of LDL were assessed with respect to socioeconomic characteristics of residents in the State of Georgia. Using US Census Bureau Data (2000), Census Block Groups (CBGs) adjacent to LDLs were compared to CBGs outside of LDLs on four socioeconomic variables (per capita income, occupation, education, and race) in urban, suburban and rural environments. Results showed that CBGs adjacent to LDLs were composed of statistically significant upper-class communities containing fewer blue-collar workers, more whites, and higher income and higher educated people in rural, suburban and urban areas. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling spatial accessibility to parks: A national study,"Zhang, X.; Lu, H.; Holt, J.B.","Background: Parks provide ideal open spaces for leisure-time physical activity and important venues to promote physical activity. The spatial configuration of parks, the number of parks and their spatial distribution across neighborhood areas or local regions, represents the basic park access potential for their residential populations. A new measure of spatial access to parks, population-weighted distance (PWD) to parks, combines the advantages of current park access approaches and incorporates the information processing theory and probability access surface model to more accurately quantify residential population's potential spatial access to parks.Results: The PWD was constructed at the basic level of US census geography - blocks - using US park and population data. This new measure of population park accessibility was aggregated to census tract, county, state and national levels. On average, US residential populations are expected to travel 6.7 miles to access their local neighborhood parks. There are significant differences in the PWD to local parks among states. The District of Columbia and Connecticut have the best access to local neighborhood parks with PWD of 0.6 miles and 1.8 miles, respectively. Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming have the largest PWDs of 62.0, 37.4, and 32.8 miles, respectively. Rural states in the western and Midwestern US have lower neighborhood park access, while urban states have relatively higher park access.Conclusions: The PWD to parks provides a consistent platform for evaluating spatial equity of park access and linking with population health outcomes. It could be an informative evaluation tool for health professionals and policy makers. This new method could be applied to quantify geographic accessibility of other types of services or destinations, such as food, alcohol, and tobacco outlets. © 2011 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2011,International Journal of Health Geographics,10,,,10.1186/1476-072X-10-31,#5420,Zhang 2011,"Zhang et al., 2011",,,,,,,,,,,,
Social disparities in tree canopy and park accessibility: A case study of six cities in Illinois using GIS and remote sensing,"Zhou, X.; Kim, J.","Easy access to green space and the presence of lush tree canopy in neighborhoods provide substantial psychophysical benefits to residents. However, these urban amenities are often unevenly distributed between white and racial/ethnic minority residents. In this study, we investigated racial/ethnic disparities in access to parks and tree canopy using a geographic information system (GIS) and remote-sensing techniques in six Illinois cities. An accessibility index based on a new Google Maps application programming interface (API) was used to calculate walking distances between points of origins and parks, and integrated classification techniques were applied to calculate the amount of tree canopy. Kernel-smoothing function was applied to both canopy and park layers to transform point value to continuous surface value. Both ordinary regression and spatial regression were used to find the relationship.The results of this study show that racial/ethnic minorities have less tree canopy in their neighborhoods, but it did not find significant differences in terms of access to parks. Spatial regression was determined to be an effective modeling approach for the data used in this study. Methods used in this study can be extended to study accessibility to various destinations using different means of transit, and the results can guide intervention programs to help reduce environmental inequity. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.",2013,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,12,1,88-97,10.1016/j.ufug.2012.11.004,#5250,Zhou 2013,"Zhou & Kim, 2013",,,,,,,,,,,,
Modeling Urban Green Access: Combining Zone-Based Proximity and Demand-Weighted Metrics in a Medium-Sized U.S. City,"Zhu, Y.; Yang, Q.; Guo, S.; Wen, Y.; Wang, X.; Wang, R.","Urban green space (UGS) accessibility is a cornerstone of equitable and sustainable city planning. However, existing studies focus on large metropolitan areas and rely on limited spatial models that overlook the complexity of urban morphology and socio-demographic diversity. This study shifts the focus to East Lansing, a medium-sized U.S. city that exhibits neither the spatial concentration of major metropolises nor the uniformity of small towns, thereby offering a distinctive context to examine urban green space equity. To this end, we develop a composite accessibility index by integrating four complementary spatial models: Euclidean distance, gravity-based access, two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA), and zone-based analysis. Utilizing high-resolution spatial, demographic, and environmental datasets, the study applies both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to uncover global patterns and local variations in accessibility determinants. The results reveal pronounced neighborhood-level disparities, with variables such as green coverage, park provision, and commercial density emerging as significant but spatially uneven predictors. The composite index yields a more robust and equitable representation of UGS accessibility than any individual model. This multi-model, spatially explicit framework contributes to methodological advances in accessibility assessment and offers actionable insights for place-based urban greening strategies. © 2025 by the authors.",2025,Land,14,9,,10.3390/land14091926,#450,Zhu 2025,"Zhu et al., 2025",,,,,,,,,,,,
